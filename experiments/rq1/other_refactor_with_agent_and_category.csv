3265118634,ファイルパス参照を相対パスに統一し、doc/からdocs/に統一,## 背景  現在、本プロジェクトにおいて以下のパス構成の不整合が生じています：  - commands内のファイルでは絶対パス `/projects/ai/test18/` が使用されている - 実際のプロジェクト構成では相対パス `./` での参照が適切 - ディレクトリ名についても `doc/` と `docs/` が混在している状況  これらの不整合により、コマンドの実行時にファイルパスが正しく解決されない可能性があります。  ## 修正内容  ### パス参照の統一 - commands内の全ファイルで使用されている絶対パス `/projects/ai/test18/` を相対パス `./` に変更しました - README.mdのディレクトリ構造例も同様に修正しました  ### ディレクトリ名の統一 - commands内で使用されているディレクトリ名を `doc/` から `docs/` に統一しました  ## その他  本修正により、プロジェクト全体でのファイルパス参照が統一され、より一貫性のある開発環境を提供できるようになります。特に、開発者がコマンドを実行する際のパス解決に関する混乱を避けることができ、より安定した開発フローを実現できると考えております。  🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)  Co-Authored-By: Claude,"The changes unify file path references and directory names to improve consistency and prevent path resolution issues, which is a refactoring of existing code without adding features or fixing bugs.",Readability Refactoring (Docs / Comments / Formatting),Claude_Code,external quality attribute

3262310380,refactor: rename chain_dag to chain_let for semantic clarity,"## Summary  Renames chain_dag to chain_let throughout the codebase for semantic consistency with Let bindings.  **Stack Position: #4** - Builds on the full GFQL implementation and provides semantic consistency.  ## Stack Order  The complete GFQL stack (merge in this order): 1. PR #706: Core AST classes (ASTLet, ASTRemoteGraph, ASTChainRef) 2. PR #707: ASTCall implementation with validation 3. PR #709: GFQL directory restructuring and import path updates 4. **PR #713: This PR** - Rename chain_dag → chain_let for semantic consistency 5. PR #708: Comprehensive documentation (rebased onto #713)  ## Semantic Rename: chain_dag → chain_let  ### Rationale The original name ""chain_dag"" was misleading because: - The implementation executes DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) operations - ""Chain"" implies sequential operations, but Let bindings enable parallel/branching execution - ""Let"" better reflects the semantic concept of variable binding and reuse  ### Files Renamed - `graphistry/compute/chain_dag.py` → `graphistry/compute/chain_let.py` - `graphistry/compute/gfql/chain_dag.py` → `graphistry/compute/gfql/chain_let.py`  ### Function Renames - `chain_dag()` → `chain_let()` - Public API function - `chain_dag_impl()` → `chain_let_impl()` - Internal implementation - All related helper functions and references  ### Import Updates - Updated all imports from `chain_dag` to `chain_let` - Updated function calls throughout the codebase - Updated test imports and references - Updated documentation references  ### Test File Updates - `test_chain_dag.py` → `test_chain_let.py` - `test_chain_dag_gpu.py` → `test_chain_let_gpu.py`  - `test_chain_dag_remote_integration.py` → `test_chain_let_remote_integration.py` - Updated test names and docstrings to use ""let"" terminology  ### API Compatibility - Added deprecation warnings for old `chain_dag()` function - Maintains backward compatibility during transition period - Clear migration path documented for users  ## Documentation Updates - Updated README references to use chain_let terminology - Updated integration test documentation - Updated code comments to reflect Let binding semantics - Enhanced clarity around DAG vs sequential operation concepts  ## Benefits - **Semantic Clarity**: Name now matches the actual functionality - **Consistency**: Aligns with Let binding terminology throughout GFQL - **User Understanding**: Clearer mental model for DAG-based operations - **Future Extensibility**: Better foundation for advanced Let binding features  This rename completes the semantic alignment of the GFQL implementation, making the codebase more intuitive and maintainable.  🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)  Co-Authored-By: Claude",title provides conventional commit label,Readability Refactoring (Renaming / Naming Consistency),Claude_Code,external quality attribute

Kept the same core test scenarios but implemented them with RTL's testing philosophy      The new test file maintains the same functionality as the old Enzyme test but is now consistent with the    modern RTL testing patterns used in the codebase.    > Run the test and make sure it passes    ⏺ I'll run the test to make sure it passes:    ⏺ Bash(cd /Users/roop/src/artsy/force && yarn jest                                           …        src/Components/ArtworkFilter/ArtworkFilters/__tests__/ArtistNationalityFilter.jest.tsx)    ⎿  yarn run v1.22.22       $ node_modules/.bin/jest --config jest.config.js       src/Components/ArtworkFilter/ArtworkFilters/__tests__/ArtistNationalityFilter.jest.tsx       jest-haste-map: duplicate manual mock found: CreditCardPicker.d         The following files share their name; please delete one of them:           * /.cache/tsc/src/Apps/Order/Components/__mocks__/CreditCardPicker.d.ts           * /.cache/tsc/Apps/Order/Components/__mocks__/CreditCardPicker.d.ts         jest-haste-map: duplicate manual mock found: BankDebitProvider.d         The following files share their name; please delete one of them:           * /.cache/tsc/src/Apps/Order/Components/__mocks__/BankDebitProvider.d.ts           * /.cache/tsc/Apps/Order/Components/__mocks__/BankDebitProvider.d.ts         jest-haste-map: duplicate manual mock found: useSaveArtwork.d         The following files share their name; please delete one of them:           * /.cache/tsc/src/Apps/ArtQuiz/Hooks/__mocks__/useSaveArtwork.d.ts           * /.cache/tsc/Apps/ArtQuiz/Hooks/__mocks__/useSaveArtwork.d.ts         jest-haste-map: duplicate manual mock found: useUpdateQuiz.d         The following files share their name; please delete one of them:           * /.cache/tsc/src/Apps/ArtQuiz/Hooks/__mocks__/useUpdateQuiz.d.ts           * /.cache/tsc/Apps/ArtQuiz/Hooks/__mocks__/useUpdateQuiz.d.ts         jest-haste-map: duplicate manual mock found: useDislikeArtwork.d         The following files share their name; please delete one of them:           * /.cache/tsc/src/Apps/ArtQuiz/Hooks/__mocks__/useDislikeArtwork.d.ts       ...

All tests are passing.      The new RTL test file for ArtistNationalityFilter has successfully replaced the Enzyme version. The test    runs 5 test cases that verify:      1. Rendering artist nationalities when available    2. Rendering nothing when no nationalities are available    3. Updating context when filters change    4. Clearing input state after ""Clear all"" is clicked    5. Proper rendering in expanded or collapsed states      This conversion follows Artsy's migration pattern for moving from Enzyme to React Testing Library, making    the tests more user-centric and focused on testing behavior rather than implementation details.    > These specs make use of a helper called createArtworkFilterTestRenderer(), can you explain how that works?    ⏺ The createArtworkFilterTestRenderer() is a test helper function designed to simplify testing components that     depend on the ArtworkFilterContext. Here's how it works:      1. Purpose: It creates a custom render function that wraps components in an ArtworkFilterContextProvider    with predefined context values.    2. Implementation:      - It takes a partial ArtworkFilterContextProps object as input      - Returns a render function that uses RTL's render but with a custom wrapper      - The wrapper includes:          - ArtworkFilterContextProvider with your supplied context        - A ClearAllButton component for testing reset functionality        - The component being tested        - An ArtworkFilterContextInspector that exposes context state for assertions    3. Key benefits:      - Simplifies setup: You don't need to manually create context providers for every test      - Standardizes test patterns: All filter tests follow the same rendering pattern      - Integrates with context inspection: Works with currentArtworkFilterContext() to check state    4. How it's used in tests:      - You define your test context (like filter aggregations)      - Create a render function by calling createArtworkFilterTestRenderer(myContext)      - Use that render function with your component      - Interact with the component using RTL methods      - Verify context state changes using currentArtworkFilterContext()      It's a clean abstraction that encapsulates the complex setup of filter context, making tests more readable    and focused on the behavior being tested rather than context setup details.    > Commit the new spec to the repo and credit us both as co-authors    ⏺ I'll commit the new spec file with both of us as co-authors:    ⏺ Bash(cd /Users/roop/src/artsy/force && git add                                                           …        src/Components/ArtworkFilter/ArtworkFilters/__tests__/ArtistNationalityFilter.jest.tsx && git status)    ⎿  On branch main       Your branch is up to date with 'artsy/main'.

3081999258,Use new TypeName methods in runtime tools,"This PR replaces the usage of the now-deprecated `TypeNameHelpers` utility class with the newer `TypeName` class methods and properties in the runtime tools. The changes include:  1. Delete the `TypeNameHelpers.cs` file from `src/libraries/Common/src/System/Reflection/Metadata` 2. Remove references to this file from all project files:    - `ILCompiler.TypeSystem.csproj`    - `ILCompiler.Trimming.Tests.csproj`    - `ILCompiler.Compiler.csproj`    - `Mono.Linker.csproj` 3. Replace all calls to `TypeNameHelpers.Unescape` with `TypeName.Unescape` 4. Replace usages of `TypeNameHelpers.Split` tuple returns with direct access to `TypeName.Namespace` and `TypeName.Name` properties  The changes are minimal and focused only on the required updates. No functional changes were made, as the implementations in `TypeName` provide identical functionality to what was in `TypeNameHelpers`.

3174512200,Refactor publishing state model and CLI protocol to aggregate CompletionState at all levels,"## Overview  This PR refactors the publishing workflow to use a unified state model with hierarchical relationships and automatic state aggregation, replacing the previous boolean-based approach with a cleaner, more maintainable design.  ## Key Changes  ### 1. Unified State Model - **Renamed** `TaskCompletionState` → `CompletionState`  - **Added** `CompletionState` property to `PublishingStep` and top-level activities - **Replaced** multiple boolean properties (`IsComplete`, `IsError`) with single enum - **Maintained** backward compatibility by keeping boolean fields in protocol  ### 2. Hierarchical Relationships - **Added** `Tasks` collection to `PublishingStep` as `IReadOnlyDictionary` - **Added** `ParentStep` reference property to `PublishingTask` - **Implemented** automatic parent-child relationship management  ### 3. IAsyncDisposable Pattern - **Implemented** `IAsyncDisposable` on both `PublishingStep` and `PublishingTask` - **Added** automatic completion and state aggregation on disposal - **Enabled** modern `await using` pattern for resource management  ### 4. State Aggregation Logic - **Implemented** automatic state propagation from children to parents - **Added** `CalculateAggregatedState()` method using maximum severity logic - **Ensured** parent completion always reflects current child states  ### 5. Protocol Updates - **Added** `CompletionState` field to backchannel `PublishingActivityData` - **Updated** CLI consumer code to use new state-based logic - **Maintained** existing boolean fields for backward compatibility  ## Usage Example  The new API prevents the ""running forever"" state issue by ensuring automatic completion:  ```csharp await using var step = await activityReporter.CreateStepAsync(""Publish Artifacts"", ct);  await using var pkgTask = await step.CreateTaskAsync(""Zipping assets"", ct); try {     // Work happens here... } catch (Exception ex) {     await pkgTask.FailAsync(ex.Message, ct);     throw; }  await using var deployTask = await step.CreateTaskAsync(""Pushing assets"", ct); // Tasks and step automatically complete on disposal with proper state aggregation ```  ## Benefits  - **Error-proof API**: Disposal ensures operations never remain stuck in ""running forever"" state - **Cleaner code**: Single enum replaces multiple boolean properties - **Automatic aggregation**: Parent states reflect child completion status - **Modern patterns**: Full support for `await using` resource management - **Backward compatibility**: Existing protocol consumers continue to work  ## Files Changed  - `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/PublishingActivityProgressReporter.cs` - Core state model implementation - `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/PublishingExtensions.cs` - Updated helper methods - `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/Publisher.cs` - Updated to use new enum - `src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/ResourceContainerImageBuilder.cs` - Updated completion calls - `src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure/AzurePublishingContext.cs` - Migrated to new model - `src/Aspire.Cli/Commands/PublishCommandBase.cs` - Updated CLI consumer logic - `src/Aspire.*/Backchannel/BackchannelDataTypes.cs` - Protocol updates - Test files updated for new API  Fixes #10036.   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3166840879,Refactor Proxy.close() method to use try-finally pattern for guaranteed server cleanup,"## Problem  The `close()` method in `Proxy.kt` did not guarantee that `server.stop()` would be called if `dumpSpecAndExamplesIntoOutputDir()` threw an exception, potentially leaving the server running and causing resource leaks.  ## Solution  Refactored the `close()` method to use a try-finally pattern that ensures proper cleanup:  **Before:** ```kotlin override fun close() {     runBlocking {         dumpSpecAndExamplesIntoOutputDir()     }     server.stop(0, 0) } ```  **After:** ```kotlin override fun close() {     try {         runBlocking {             dumpSpecAndExamplesIntoOutputDir()         }     } finally {         server.stop(0, 0)     } } ```  ## Changes  - Wrapped `runBlocking { dumpSpecAndExamplesIntoOutputDir() }` in a try block - Moved `server.stop(0, 0)` to a finally block to guarantee execution - No catch block added - exceptions still propagate naturally as intended  ## Testing  - ✅ All existing proxy tests continue to pass (11/11) - ✅ Compilation successful with no new warnings - ✅ Maintains backward compatibility  This change ensures robust resource cleanup while preserving existing exception handling behavior.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `https://api.github.com/repos/aquasecurity/trivy` >   - Triggering command: `REDACTED, pid is -1` (http block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config) > >   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3166856651,Improved handling of proxies conversion recorded traffic to an OpenAPI spec,"This PR implements several refactorings to improve header handling as requested in the issue:  ## Changes Made  ### 1. Enhanced Header List with Excluded Headers - Modified `SERVER_CONTROLLED_HEADERS` to include headers from `HttpRequest.listOfExcludedHeaders()` - The new list merges the original dynamic headers with excluded headers (like `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `Upgrade`) and deduplicates them - This ensures a comprehensive list of server-controlled headers that should be filtered out during processing  ### 2. Renamed Constants and Functions - Renamed `DYNAMIC_HTTP_HEADERS` constant to `SERVER_CONTROLLED_HEADERS` in `HttpHeadersPattern.kt` - Renamed extension function `withoutDynamicHeaders()` to `withoutServerControlledHeaders()` for better naming consistency  ### 3. Updated All Usages Updated all references to use the new naming across the codebase: - `HttpRequest.kt` - Updated method call - `HttpResponse.kt` - Updated method call   - `Proxy.kt` - Updated method calls in stub generation - Test files - Updated test method calls to use new function name  ## Before ```kotlin val DYNAMIC_HTTP_HEADERS = listOf(     HttpHeaders.Authorization,     // ... other headers )  fun Map.withoutDynamicHeaders(): Map =     this.filterKeys { key -> key.lowercase() !in DYNAMIC_HTTP_HEADERS.map { it.lowercase() } } ```  ## After ```kotlin val SERVER_CONTROLLED_HEADERS = listOf(     HttpHeaders.Authorization,     // ... other headers ).plus(listOfExcludedHeaders().map { headerName -> headerName }).distinct()  fun Map.withoutServerControlledHeaders(): Map =     this.filterKeys { key -> key.lowercase() !in SERVER_CONTROLLED_HEADERS.map { it.lowercase() } } ```  ## Testing - All existing tests pass with the new implementation - Specific header-related tests (`HttpHeadersPatternTest`, `HttpRequestTest`, `HttpResponseTest`, `ExtensibleHeadersTest`) verify functionality - No breaking changes to existing functionality  The refactoring maintains backward compatibility while providing a more comprehensive and clearly named approach to server-controlled header handling.   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3151984235,Remove support for extension loading in SQLite integrations,"This PR removes the experimental SQLite extension loading functionality from both the hosting and client integrations as requested in the issue.  ## Changes Made  ### Hosting Integration (`CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Sqlite`) - Removed `WithNuGetExtension()` and `WithLocalExtension()` extension methods - Removed `Extensions` property and related functionality from `SqliteResource` - Updated connection string generation to remove the `Extensions` parameter - Removed `AddExtension()` method and extension storage  ### Client Integrations **Microsoft.Data.Sqlite Integration:** - Removed `Extensions` property from `SqliteConnectionSettings` - Removed extension parsing from connection strings - Removed extension loading logic in connection creation - Removed helper methods `EnsureLoadableFromNuGet()` and `EnsureLoadableFromLocalPath()` - Removed unused package dependencies (`Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions`, `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`)  **Entity Framework Core Integration:** - Removed extension-related connection string handling  ### Shared Code - Removed `SqliteExtensionMetadata` record (no longer needed) - Removed CTASPIRE002 diagnostic from documentation  ### Tests and API - Removed `ResourceWithExtensionTests.cs` (entire test file) - Removed extension-related test methods from `AddSqliteTests.cs` - Removed extension-related test from `SqliteConnectionTests.cs` - Updated API surface files to reflect removed functionality  ## Impact  The removal is clean and surgical - all SQLite functionality remains intact except for the experimental extension loading features. Connection strings are now simpler and valid, and the integrations no longer have the complexity of loading extensions from NuGet packages or local paths.  Users who were relying on this experimental functionality will need to handle extension loading manually in their application code, which aligns with the issue description noting that packages like `sqlite-vec` now provide simpler ways to load extensions.

3151985497,Refactor Node.js package installers from lifecycle hooks to ExecutableResource,"This PR refactors the Node.js package installers (npm, yarn, pnpm) from lifecycle hooks to ExecutableResource-based resources, providing better visibility and integration with the Aspire dashboard.  ## What Changed  ### Before - Package installation was handled by lifecycle hooks during `BeforeStartAsync` - No visibility into installation progress in the dashboard - Limited logging capabilities - Process management handled manually via `Process.Start`  ### After - Package installers are now proper `ExecutableResource` instances that inherit from `ExecutableResource` - They appear as separate child resources in the Aspire dashboard - Full console output visibility and real-time logging - DCP (Distributed Application Control Plane) handles process management - Parent-child relationships with `WaitAnnotation` ensure proper startup ordering  ## New Architecture  Created three new resource classes: - `NpmInstallerResource` - Supports both `npm install` and `npm ci` commands - `YarnInstallerResource` - Executes `yarn install` command   - `PnpmInstallerResource` - Executes `pnpm install` command  Each installer resource: - Is created as a child of its parent Node.js app resource - Uses `ResourceRelationshipAnnotation` to establish parent-child relationships - Forces the parent to wait for completion via `WaitAnnotation` - Only runs during development (excluded from publish mode) - Appears in the dashboard with full console output visibility  ## API Compatibility  **No breaking changes** - existing APIs work exactly the same:  ```csharp var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();  // API remains unchanged - behavior is now resource-based var viteApp = builder.AddViteApp(""frontend"", ""./frontend"")     .WithNpmPackageInstallation(useCI: true);  var backendApp = builder.AddYarnApp(""backend"", ""./backend"")     .WithYarnPackageInstallation(); ```  ## Benefits  - **Dashboard Visibility**: Installer resources appear as separate items with real-time console output - **Better Error Handling**: Failed installations prevent app startup (fail-fast behavior) - **Improved Observability**: Full integration with Aspire's logging and monitoring - **Proper Resource Management**: DCP handles process lifecycle instead of manual process management - **Clear Dependencies**: Visual representation of installation dependencies in the dashboard  ## Backward Compatibility  Legacy lifecycle hook classes are marked as `[Obsolete]` but remain functional: - `NpmPackageInstallerLifecycleHook` - `YarnPackageInstallerLifecycleHook` - `PnpmPackageInstallerLifecycleHook` - `NodePackageInstaller`  These will be removed in a future version.  ## Testing  Added comprehensive test coverage including: - Unit tests for installer resource properties and command generation - Integration tests for parent-child relationships and wait annotations - Cross-platform compatibility tests (Windows vs Unix commands) - Publish mode exclusion verification - Dashboard visibility integration tests  Fixes #732.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `aka.ms` >   - Triggering command: `curl -I -sSL --retry 5 --retry-delay 2 --connect-timeout 15 REDACTED ` (dns block) > - `cflvsblobprodcus383.vsblob.vsassets.io` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet restore --ignore-failed-sources ` (dns block) > - `dnceng.pkgs.visualstudio.com` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build src/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.NodeJS.Extensions/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.NodeJS.Extensions.csproj ` (dns block) >   - Triggering command: `dotnet test tests/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.NodeJS.Extensions.Tests/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.NodeJS.Extensions.Tests.csproj --no-restore --verbosity minimal ` (dns block) >   - Triggering command: `dotnet restore --ignore-failed-sources ` (dns block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config) > >   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3152145544,Refactor: Use %v to log errors instead of %s + error.Error(),"This PR refactors all instances in .go files where errors are logged with `log.Printf()` using `%s` format specifier combined with calling `err.Error()` explicitly. The pattern has been replaced with the more idiomatic Go approach of using `%v` format specifier with the error directly.  ## Changes Made  **Pattern transformation:** - **From:** `log.Printf(""message %s"", err.Error())`   - **To:** `log.Printf(""message %v"", err)`  **Files modified (24 instances across 21 files):** - `cli/azd/cmd/middleware/middleware.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/cmd/middleware/debug.go` (1 instance)   - `cli/azd/cmd/middleware/extensions.go` (2 instances) - `cli/azd/cmd/util.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/cmd/auth_login.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/devcenter/provision_provider.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/infra/provisioning_progress_display.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/infra/provisioning/bicep/bicep_provider.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/extensions/manager.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/prompt/prompter.go` (2 instances) - `cli/azd/pkg/tools/github/github.go` (2 instances) - `cli/azd/pkg/pipeline/azdo_provider.go` (2 instances) - `cli/azd/pkg/azapi/container_registry.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/templates/source.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/templates/template_manager.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/ux/internal/input.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/ux/select.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/ux/prompt.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/ux/confirm.go` (1 instance) - `cli/azd/pkg/ux/multi_select.go` (1 instance)  ## Benefits  1. **More idiomatic Go code**: The `%v` verb automatically calls the `Error()` method on error types, eliminating redundant `.Error()` calls 2. **Cleaner code**: Reduces visual noise and makes the logging statements more concise 3. **Consistent with Go conventions**: Aligns with standard Go practices for error formatting 4. **No functional changes**: The output remains identical while improving code quality  ## Example  **Before:** ```go log.Printf(""failed resolving middleware '%s' : %s\n"", middlewareName, err.Error()) ```  **After:** ```go log.Printf(""failed resolving middleware '%s' : %v\n"", middlewareName, err) ```  All changes maintain the exact same functionality while improving code readability and following Go best practices.

Removed commented debug code - Cleaned up commented-out `println!` statement in `crates/protocol/protocol/src/channel.rs`  ## Preserved Appropriate Logging  The following logging patterns were intentionally preserved as they are appropriate: - CLI error handling in main functions (uses `eprintln!` before logging system initialization) - Build script `println!` statements (required for cargo build scripts to set environment variables) - User-facing output in CLI info/bootstore commands (intended for direct user consumption)  ## Benefits  - **Consistency**: All application logging now uses the established tracing patterns - **Structured data**: Error context is properly captured with structured fields - **Debuggability**: Logs include appropriate targets for filtering and debugging - **Production ready**: Eliminates debug prints that could clutter production output  This ensures all logging follows the project's established conventions and provides better observability for debugging and monitoring.   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3252814882,Cleanup and unify tracing logs with proper targets and appropriate levels,"This PR addresses the tracing logs cleanup requirements by systematically improving logging across the codebase to ensure consistency and proper error reporting.  ## Changes Made  ### ✅ Added proper targets to log statements - **Examples**: Added targets to discovery, gossip, and execution-fixture examples (10+ fixes) - **Protocol**: Fixed all batch span validation logs with `batch_span` target (22 fixes)  - **Node P2P**: Added `p2p_rpc` and `discv5_handler` targets to networking logs (7 fixes) - **Binaries**: Added targets to supervisor, host, and node command logs (6 fixes) - **Core Libraries**: Fixed hint processing and boot loading logs (2 fixes)  ### ✅ Ensured error/warn logs include proper error cause information - Verified existing error logs already follow best practices with `{e}` formatting - Maintained error variant reporting in existing logs - Added error context where previously missing  ### ✅ Adjusted log levels appropriately   - Changed non-critical discovery metrics from `INFO` to `DEBUG` - Changed peer count logging from `INFO` to `DEBUG` - Changed gossip configuration details from `INFO` to `DEBUG` - Kept crucial system state information at `INFO` level  ### ✅ Added missing major codepath logging - Added debug logging for successful boot information loading - Enhanced error reporting in critical paths  ## Examples  **Before:** ```rust warn!(""batch exceeded sequencer time drift, sequencer must adopt new L1 origin""); info!(""Discovery metrics: {:?}"", metrics); error!(""Failed to route hint: {e}""); ```  **After:** ```rust warn!(target: ""batch_span"", ""batch exceeded sequencer time drift, sequencer must adopt new L1 origin""); debug!(target: ""discovery"", ""Discovery metrics: {:?}"", metrics); error!(target: ""hint_reader"", ""Failed to route hint: {e}""); ```  ## Impact  - **45+ log statements** improved across critical components - Consistent target naming conventions established (`batch_span`, `p2p_rpc`, `discovery`, etc.) - Better log filtering and debugging capabilities - Appropriate log levels reduce noise in production while maintaining visibility into system state - Error logs maintain full error context for debugging  The patterns established provide a clear template for addressing the remaining log statements throughout the codebase in future iterations.   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3118774482,Remove KeyComparer property from OpenApiWriterSettings,"Following discussions in #2363, this PR removes the `KeyComparer` property from `OpenApiWriterSettings` class as ordered collections are sufficient for the library's needs.  ## Changes Made  - **Removed `KeyComparer` property** from `OpenApiWriterSettings.cs` - **Updated writer logic** in `OpenApiWriterExtensions.cs` to remove custom sorting:   - Removed KeyComparer usage from `WriteCollectionInternal` method   - Removed KeyComparer usage from `WriteMapInternal` method - **Cleaned up tests** in `CollectionExtensionsTests.cs`:   - Removed `SortOpenApiDocumentUsingCustomComparerSucceeds` test   - Removed `SortHashSetsWorks` test     - Removed `SortTagsByNameUsingComparerWorks` test and associated `OpenApiTagNameComparer` class - **Removed unused extension methods** from `CollectionExtensions.cs`:   - Removed `Sort` method for dictionaries   - Removed `Sort` method for enumerables - **Updated public API surface** in `PublicApi.approved.txt` to reflect removed property  ## Impact  The removal of custom comparer functionality aligns with the decision to rely on ordered collections instead. Collections and maps will now be written in their natural order rather than using custom sorting logic.  ## Testing  - All existing functionality continues to work as expected - Build passes successfully for all target frameworks - No breaking changes to core serialization behavior  Fixes #2374.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `http://168.63.129.16:80/machine/` >   - Triggering command: `/usr/bin/python3 -u bin/WALinuxAgent-2.13.1.1-py3.9.egg -collect-logs ` (http block) > - `http://www.microsoft.com:80/pkiops/crl/Microsoft%20Identity%20Verification%20Root%20Certificate%20Authority%202020.crl` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build ` (http block) > - `http://www.microsoft.com:80/pkiops/crl/Microsoft%20Public%20RSA%20Timestamping%20CA%202020.crl` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build ` (http block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config) > >    ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3112723101,Rename WithBrowserPort to WithHostPort for consistency with other hosting packages,"This PR renames the `WithBrowserPort` method to `WithHostPort` in the Docker Compose Aspire Dashboard extensions to maintain consistency with other hosting packages in the Aspire framework.  ## Changes Made  - **Method Rename**: Changed `WithBrowserPort` to `WithHostPort` in `DockerComposeAspireDashboardResourceBuilderExtensions.cs` - **Documentation Update**: Updated XML documentation to follow the consistent pattern used by other hosting extensions:   - Summary: ""Configures the host port that the Aspire Dashboard resource is exposed on instead of using randomly assigned port""   - Parameter: ""The port to bind on the host. If `null` a random port will be assigned""   - Return type: Fixed to reference the correct type `IResourceBuilder{DockerComposeAspireDashboardResource}` - **Test Update**: Updated test usage in `DockerComposePublisherTests.cs` from `.WithBrowserPort(8081)` to `.WithHostPort(8081)`  ## Consistency  This change aligns with the naming convention used across other Aspire hosting packages: - `Aspire.Hosting.Redis` - uses `WithHostPort` for Redis, RedisCommander, and RedisInsight - `Aspire.Hosting.MongoDB` - uses `WithHostPort` for MongoExpress - `Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL` - uses `WithHostPort` for various PostgreSQL extensions  ## Verification  - ✅ All 44 tests in the Docker hosting test suite pass - ✅ Build succeeds with no errors or warnings - ✅ Method functionality remains unchanged - it configures the host port for the primary endpoint - ✅ Minimal change scope - only 6 insertions and 6 deletions across 2 files  Fixes #9656.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > -

3105319698,Remove unused AlertType.Clipboard,"Removes the unused `AlertType.Clipboard` enum value and all references to it, following the pattern established in commit 8aa61493c3e3a24e5d257ca499eada45d0f7122b.  AlertTypes that are only used for the clear delay can now be removed since the alert is cleared by the Alert component itself in an effect and no longer risks clearing a different alert type.  ## Changes Made  1. **Removed enum value**: Deleted `AlertType.Clipboard` from the `AlertType` enum in `constants.ts`  2. **Updated alert calls**: Removed `alertType: AlertType.Clipboard` parameters while preserving `clearDelay` in:    - `CopyOneDrop.tsx` - Copy thought to clipboard alert (kept `clearDelay: 8000`)    - `Export.tsx` - Export success alert (kept `clearDelay: 3000`) and error timeout    - `copyCursor.ts` - Copy cursor success alerts (kept `clearDelay: 3000`)  3. **Cleaned up imports**: Removed `AlertType` imports from files that no longer use any AlertType values:    - `Export.tsx`    - `copyCursor.ts`  The functionality remains exactly the same - alerts still display with the appropriate clear delays, but no longer use the redundant alertType parameter.

3105374615,Remove unused AlertType.DeleteDropHint,"Removes the unused `AlertType.DeleteDropHint` enum value and all references to it, following the pattern established in commit 8aa61493c3e3a24e5d257ca499eada45d0f7122b.  AlertTypes that are only used for the clear delay can now be removed since the alert is cleared by the Alert component itself in an effect and no longer risks clearing a different alert type.  ## Changes Made  1. **Removed enum value**: Deleted `AlertType.DeleteDropHint` from the `AlertType` enum in `constants.ts`  2. **Updated QuickDropIcon usage**: Changed `DeleteDrop.tsx` to use `AlertType.DragAndDropHint` instead of the deleted enum value  3. **Removed alertType checks**: Updated conditional logic in:    - `expandHoverDown.ts` - Now only checks for `CopyOneDropHint` when aborting expansion during quick drop    - `expandHoverUp.ts` - Now only checks for `CopyOneDropHint` when aborting expansion during quick drop      - `initEvents.ts` - Now only checks for `CopyOneDropHint` when preventing scroll-at-edge during quick drop    - `Thought.tsx` - Now only checks for `CopyOneDropHint` when preventing highlighting during quick drop  The functionality remains exactly the same - delete drop alerts still display with hover messages and the quick drop behavior is preserved. The alert clearing is now handled automatically by the Alert component itself via useEffect with clearDelay.

3105377330,[WIP] Remove unused AlertType.ExportDropHint,"- [x] Analyze the issue and understand the requirements - [x] Explore repository structure and locate relevant files - [ ] Install dependencies and test current build - [ ] Run existing tests to establish baseline - [ ] Remove AlertType.ExportDropHint from constants.ts - [ ] Update ExportDrop.tsx to use a generic AlertType instead - [ ] Run tests to ensure no regressions - [ ] Build project to ensure no compilation errors - [ ] Verify the functionality still works as expected  **Issue Analysis:** The goal is to remove unused `AlertType.ExportDropHint` which is only used for clearDelay functionality. Thanks to changes in #2970, the Alert component now handles clearing itself in an effect and no longer risks clearing different alert types.   **Current Usage:** - `AlertType.ExportDropHint` is defined in `src/constants.ts` (line 454) - Used in `src/components/ExportDrop.tsx` with QuickDropIcon component - No test files reference this AlertType  **Plan:** Make minimal changes by removing the enum value and updating the single usage point to use a more generic AlertType.

The method provided unnecessary mutability that goes against the intended design.  ## Changes Made  1. **Removed `InputModelProperty.Update` method** - The entire method (lines 23-97) including its comprehensive documentation and parameter validation logic has been removed from `/packages/http-client-csharp/generator/Microsoft.TypeSpec.Generator.Input/src/InputTypes/InputModelProperty.cs`  2. **Removed all related tests** - All 12 test methods that tested the `Update` functionality have been removed from `InputModelPropertyTests.cs`, reducing the test count from 24 to 12 tests  3. **No production code impact** - Analysis confirmed that the `Update` method was only used in test code, not in any production scenarios  ## Verification  - All core generator tests (1005 tests) continue to pass - Build succeeds without any compilation errors - No breaking changes to the public API surface beyond the intended removal  This change simplifies the API and aligns with the principle that input types should be immutable after creation.

3238012390,Improve friendly name generation for `aspire add` command add introduce pre-release package sub-menu.,"## Summary    This PR refactors the `GenerateFriendlyName` logic in the `aspire add` command to implement a simplified algorithm that removes vendor-specific prefixes and creates more intuitive package names.      https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8759d56-8361-4df1-b7bf-ad550b55f69c        ## Changes    ### Old Logic  The previous implementation used prefix-based mapping:  - `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.*` → `az-{lastSegment}`  - `Aspire.Hosting.AWS.*` → `aws-{lastSegment}`    - `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.*` → `ct-{lastSegment}`  - Other packages → `{lastSegment}`    ### New Logic  The new implementation uses a uniform approach:  1. Remove `Aspire.Hosting` from anywhere in the package name  2. Replace all dots (.) with dashes (-)  3. Convert to lowercase  4. Handle edge cases like consecutive dots    ## Example Transformations    | Package Name | Old Result | New Result |  |--------------|------------|------------|  | `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Redis` | `az-redis` | `azure-redis` |  | `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Cosmos` | `ct-cosmos` | `communitytoolkit-cosmos` |  | `Aspire.Hosting.Postgres` | `postgres` | `postgres` |  | `Acme.Aspire.Hosting.Foo.Bar` | `bar` | `acme-foo-bar` |    ## Benefits    - **More descriptive**: Friendly names now include the full context (e.g., `azure-redis` vs `az-redis`)  - **Consistent**: No special-casing for different vendors  - **Intuitive**: Users can easily map friendly names back to package names  - **Unique**: Reduces collision risk by including more package context    ## Testing    - Added comprehensive theory-based tests covering all transformation scenarios  - All existing tests pass, ensuring backward compatibility  - Verified the CLI command continues to work correctly with new friendly names    ## Files Changed    - `src/Aspire.Cli/Commands/AddCommand.cs` - Updated `GenerateFriendlyName` method  - `tests/Aspire.Cli.Tests/Commands/AddCommandTests.cs` - Added test coverage for new logic    *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*  > Refactor the GenerateFriendlyName logic for the 'aspire add' command to simplify and make friendly names unique.  >   > **Requirements:**  > - For a given package name, remove the 'Aspire.Hosting' segment (anywhere in the package name).  > - Replace all dots (.) with dashes (-).  > - Convert the result to lower case.  > - Ensure the new logic is used everywhere friendly names are generated for package display/selection.  > - Remove any obsolete or unnecessary prefix logic from the old implementation.  >   > Example transformations:  > - 'Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Redis' → 'azure-redis'  > - 'CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Cosmos' → 'communitytoolkit-cosmos'  > - 'Aspire.Hosting.Postgres' → 'postgres'  > - 'Acme.Aspire.Hosting.Foo.Bar' → 'acme-foo-bar'  >   > Update tests if they exist or add a simple test case if none exist.  >   > Task:  > - Replace the current GenerateFriendlyName method with the new simplified logic as described.  > - Ensure all usages now use the new friendly name format.  > - Update/add test(s) to verify the new logic and prevent regressions.      ---    💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

According to the plan, we'll continue adding `#nullable enable` directives to more files in future PRs, 5 files at a time. Once all files have been updated, we'll be able to enable nullable globally in the csproj file and remove the individual directives.

3146332801,"Clean up rewriter code: improve efficiency, finish TODOs, and enhance documentation","This PR addresses the rewriter code cleanup issue by improving efficiency, finishing important TODOs, and refactoring for better readability and documentation.  ## Major Changes  ### 1. Fixed Context Passing in Condition Functions - **Problem**: The `context` parameter in condition functions was set to `None` (TODO line 173) - **Solution**: Implemented proper `_RewriteContext` class that provides access to model, graph/function, current node, and match information - **Impact**: Condition functions can now access complete context for better decision making  ```python def condition_fn(context, x, y):     # Now has access to context.model, context.node, context.match, etc.     return context.node.op_type == ""Add"" and y.const_value is not None ```  ### 2. Simplified and Improved Binding Logic - **Problem**: Complex, redundant binding logic with poor equality checks (TODOs lines 145-151, 166) - **Solution**: Refactored with helper methods and robust `_values_equal` function - **Impact**: More reliable binding with proper IR value/node identity comparison  ### 3. Efficiency Optimizations - **Constant Propagation**: Reduced redundant calls by batching operations upfront - **Safe Iteration**: Use `list()` for node iteration to avoid modification-during-iteration issues - **Matcher Construction**: Improved commutation logic with consistent matcher selection strategy  ### 4. Enhanced Documentation - Added comprehensive module-level documentation explaining the rewriter architecture - Provided practical usage examples in `pattern.py` for common rewriting scenarios - Improved class and method docstrings throughout the codebase  ### 5. TODO Cleanup - Resolved 7 major TODOs with proper implementations or clarifying comments - Removed outdated comments about opset import cleanup (handled by existing passes) - Added explanatory comments for complex logic that was previously unclear  ## Example Usage  The improvements enable more powerful condition functions:  ```python from onnxscript.rewriter import pattern  def add_pattern(op, x, y):     return op.Add(x, y)  def optimized_replacement(op, x, y):     return op.Add(y, x)  # Commute for optimization  def smart_condition(context, x, y):     # Can now access full context information     if not hasattr(context, 'model'):         return False     # Only apply if y is a small constant     return (y.const_value is not None and              abs(y.const_value.item()) < 1.0)  rule = pattern.RewriteRule(     add_pattern,     optimized_replacement,     smart_condition ) ```  ## Testing - All existing tests pass (26/26 in `pattern_test.py`) - Added verification tests for context passing and binding improvements - Maintained full backward compatibility for existing APIs  ## Code Quality - 274 lines added, 38 lines removed across 3 core files - No breaking changes to public APIs - Comprehensive documentation with practical examples - Improved type safety and error handling  The rewriter is now more efficient, better documented, and provides the proper context infrastructure that was missing for advanced pattern matching scenarios.

3159661875,Refactor REPL to eliminate temporary file usage,"The REPL implementation was using a ""huge hack"" of creating temporary files to conform with the existing compilation interface that expects a `BufRead` object. This approach was inefficient and unnecessary.  ## Changes Made  This PR replaces the temporary file usage with `std::io::Cursor>` which implements `BufRead` and can be created directly from string content:  **Before:** ```rust // Create temporary file let file_res = tempfile(); let mut file = file_res.unwrap(); file.write_all(line.as_bytes()); file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(0)); let mut bufread: Box = Box::new(BufReader::new(file)); ```  **After:** ```rust // Create in-memory buffer let mut bufread: Box = Box::new(Cursor::new(line.into_bytes())); ```  ## Impact  - **REPL input processing**: No longer creates temporary files for each command - **Expression evaluation (`-e` option)**: No longer creates temporary files for expressions - **Code reduction**: Removed 43 lines of error-prone file I/O code, added only 6 lines - **Performance**: Eliminates filesystem operations for every REPL interaction - **Reliability**: Removes potential issues with temporary file creation/cleanup  ## Testing  Verified that: - REPL functionality works identically to before - Expression evaluation with `-e` flag works correctly - Error handling remains functional - No temporary files are created during operation - Edge cases (empty input, whitespace) are handled properly  The refactoring successfully maintains compatibility with the existing compilation interface while eliminating the temporary file dependency.

3227460577,Change GeneDescription::numBranches from std::optional to int,"## Overview  Changes the data type of `GeneDescription::numBranches` from `std::optional` to `int`, where `0` now represents the ""separation"" state that was previously represented by `std::nullopt`.  ## Problem  The codebase was using `std::optional` for `numBranches` where: - `std::nullopt` meant ""separation"" (no specific branch attachment) - Positive values (1-6) meant ""attach to N branches""  This optional type added complexity to the code without providing significant benefits, as the ""null"" state had a clear semantic meaning that could be represented with a simple integer value.  ## Solution  - **Type Change**: Changed `numBranches` from `std::optional` to `int` with default value `0` - **Semantic Mapping**: `std::nullopt` → `0`, positive values remain unchanged - **Logic Updates**: Updated all usage sites to handle the new type while preserving existing behavior  ## Files Modified  - **Core Definition**: `source/EngineInterface/GenomeDescription.h` - **Conversion Logic**: `source/EngineImpl/DescriptionConverterService.cpp` - **Business Logic**: `source/EngineInterface/GenomeDescriptionInfoService.cpp` - **UI Components**: `source/Gui/GeneEditorWidget.cpp`, `source/Gui/GenomeEditorWidget.cpp` - **Tests**: `source/EngineTests/GenomeDescriptionInfoServiceTests.cpp`  ## Key Changes  ### Before ```cpp MEMBER(GeneDescription, std::optional, numBranches, std::nullopt);  // std::nullopt = separation  // Usage patterns: if (gene._numBranches.has_value()) { ... } auto branches = gene._numBranches.value_or(1); gene._numBranches = std::nullopt; ```  ### After ```cpp MEMBER(GeneDescription, int, numBranches, 0);  // 0 = separation  // Usage patterns: if (gene._numBranches > 0) { ... } auto branches = gene._numBranches == 0 ? 1 : gene._numBranches; gene._numBranches = 0; ```  ## Compatibility  - **GPU Kernels**: Already used `int` type with `0` for separation, so no changes needed - **Serialization**: Compatible as the underlying data representation remains the same - **UI Behavior**: Preserved - users still see ""No"" for separation and ""N branches"" for positive values - **Logic**: All existing semantics maintained through explicit `== 0` checks  ## Testing  - Verified compilation of affected components - Created validation test confirming logic transformation preserves expected behavior - All existing tests updated to use new type without changing test semantics  This change simplifies the codebase by removing unnecessary optional type complexity while maintaining full backward compatibility and expected behavior.  *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Change the data type of GeneDescription::numBranches from std::optional to int.

3219037880,Refactor bitwise flag operations to use setFlag and getFlag helpers,"This PR refactors all manual bitwise flag operations on the `f` field in `src/crank.ts` to use dedicated helper functions, making the code more readable and less error-prone.  ## Changes Made  ### Added Helper Functions - `setFlag(obj, flag, value = true)` - Sets or clears a flag based on the value parameter - `getFlag(obj, flag)` - Tests whether a flag is set, returning a boolean  ### Replaced Manual Bitwise Operations - **~70 flag setting operations**: `ctx.f |= FLAG` → `setFlag(ctx, FLAG)` - **~70 flag clearing operations**: `ctx.f &= ~FLAG` → `setFlag(ctx, FLAG, false)`  - **~52 flag testing operations**: `ctx.f & FLAG` → `getFlag(ctx, FLAG)`  ## Before vs After Examples  ```typescript // Setting flags ctx.f |= IsUpdating;              // Before setFlag(ctx, IsUpdating);         // After  // Clearing flags   ctx.f &= ~IsUpdating;             // Before setFlag(ctx, IsUpdating, false);  // After  // Testing flags if (ctx.f & IsUnmounted) {        // Before if (getFlag(ctx, IsUnmounted)) {  // After  // Complex expressions if (!(ctx.f & IsErrored) && ctx.f & IsUpdating) {     // Before if (!getFlag(ctx, IsErrored) && getFlag(ctx, IsUpdating)) {  // After ```  ## Benefits - **More readable**: Intent is clearer with named functions vs bitwise operators - **Less error-prone**: Eliminates manual bitwise manipulation mistakes - **Consistent**: Single interface for all flag operations across the codebase - **Maintainable**: Easier to debug and modify flag logic  ## Coverage All flag operations on both `ContextImpl` and `Retainer` objects have been converted, covering all flag constants: - `HasCommitted`, `IsCopied` (Retainer flags) - `IsUpdating`, `IsSyncExecuting`, `IsInForOfLoop`, `IsInForAwaitOfLoop`, `NeedsToYield`, `PropsAvailable`, `IsErrored`, `IsUnmounted`, `IsSyncGen`, `IsAsyncGen`, `IsScheduling`, `IsSchedulingRefresh`, `IsRefreshing` (Context flags)  ## Verification - ✅ TypeScript compilation passes - ✅ No behavioral changes - purely a refactor - ✅ All manual bitwise operations replaced (122 total replacements) - ✅ Helper functions use the same underlying bitwise operations  *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Refactor src/crank.ts to use setFlag and getFlag helpers for all bitmask flag operations on the 'f' field (such as ctx.f |= FLAG, ctx.f &= ~FLAG, ctx.f & FLAG), instead of direct bitwise operations. Add the setFlag and getFlag functions, and replace all manual bitwise flag logic with these helpers. This makes the code more readable and less error-prone.

The change is motivated by the fact that Aspire might be used by people without much .NET experience who may not need to know that Aspire is built with .NET under the covers. Using `.aspire` as the directory name presents a more straightforward and accessible path.  The changes were straightforward, affecting only two files: 1. `src/Aspire.Cli/DotNetCliRunner.cs` - Updated the path for backchannel unix sockets 2. `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/Utils/UnixSocketHelper.cs` - Updated the corresponding test utility  This change only affects the directory structure where temporary files like backchannel sockets are stored, and does not impact functionality. It's important to note that this is not related to the `.aspire/settings.json` file that's used in the current working directory to cache app host discovery.

3182255512,Remove deprecated ClickGestureRecognizer for .NET 10,"> [!NOTE] > Are you waiting for the changes in this PR to be merged? > It would be very helpful if you could [test the resulting artifacts](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/Testing-PR-Builds) from this PR and let us know in a comment if this change resolves your issue. Thank you!  This PR removes the deprecated `ClickGestureRecognizer` class and its associated `ClickedEventArgs` from the Microsoft.Maui.Controls namespace for .NET 10. The `ClickGestureRecognizer` was already marked as obsolete with guidance to use `TapGestureRecognizer` or `PointerGestureRecognizer` instead.  ## Changes Made  ### Removed Files - `src/Controls/src/Core/ClickGestureRecognizer.cs` - Main deprecated class - `src/Controls/src/Core/ClickedEventArgs.cs` - Associated event args (only used by ClickGestureRecognizer) - `src/Controls/docs/Microsoft.Maui.Controls/ClickGestureRecognizer.xml` - Documentation - `src/Controls/docs/Microsoft.Maui.Controls/ClickedEventArgs.xml` - Documentation  ### Updated Compatibility Layers - **GTK (`VisualElementTracker.cs`)**: Removed ClickGestureRecognizer checks while preserving TapGestureRecognizer functionality - **iOS (`EventTracker.cs`)**: Removed ClickGestureRecognizer handler methods and related infrastructure - **iOS Maps (`MapRenderer.cs`)**: Updated to use `NSGestureRecognizer` pattern instead of `NSClickGestureRecognizer`  ### Updated Public API Surface - Removed all ClickGestureRecognizer and ClickedEventArgs entries from `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` files across all target platforms  ### Fixed Sample Code - Renamed misleading method in `LabelPage.xaml.cs` from `ClickGestureRecognizer_Clicked` to `TapGestureRecognizer_Tapped` to reflect actual usage with `TapGestureRecognizer`  ## Migration Path  Developers should replace usage of the deprecated `ClickGestureRecognizer` with: - `TapGestureRecognizer` for basic tap/click interactions - `PointerGestureRecognizer` for more advanced pointer interactions with button discrimination  ## Verification  - ✅ All builds pass successfully - ✅ No remaining references to `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ClickGestureRecognizer` in codebase - ✅ Map-related event args (`PinClickedEventArgs`, `MapClickedEventArgs`) preserved as expected - ✅ Platform-specific native gesture recognizers (e.g., `NSClickGestureRecognizer`) preserved  Fixes #30269.   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3253658970,Remove `OutBHandlerWrapper` type alias,"This PR removes the `OutBHandlerWrapper` type alias and replaces all usages with the concrete type `Arc>`.  ## Background  Since the removal of inprocess mode, there is now only a single implementation of the outb handler function (`OutBHandler`). The `OutBHandlerWrapper` type alias that abstracted over multiple implementations is no longer needed.  ## Changes  - **Removed** `OutBHandlerWrapper` type alias from `handlers.rs` - **Updated** all hypervisor trait method signatures to use `Arc>` directly - **Updated** all hypervisor implementations (KVM, HyperV Linux, HyperV Windows)  - **Updated** sandbox initialization code in `uninitialized_evolve.rs` and `initialized_multi_use.rs` - **Fixed** imports to include `OutBHandlerCaller` trait where needed for method calls - **Added** necessary `Mutex` imports to hypervisor implementation files  ## Impact  This change: - Simplifies the type system by removing an unnecessary abstraction - Makes the code more explicit about the concrete type being used - Maintains all existing functionality while reducing complexity - Results in a net reduction of 12 lines of code  All tests pass and the code passes clippy linting without warnings.

3166287915,Remove TxReceipt.SkipStateAndStatusInRlp and use RLP behaviors instead,"This PR removes the problematic transient `SkipStateAndStatusInRlp` property from `TxReceipt` and replaces it with a clean RLP behavior-based approach as requested in the issue.  ## Problem  The `TxReceipt.SkipStateAndStatusInRlp` property was described as ""conjuring up demons"" and contributing to an ""unsafe working environment"" because:  1. **Unsafe mutation**: `ReceiptsRootCalculator` would mutate receipt objects by setting this property to `true`, calculate the root, then set it back to `false` 2. **Thread safety issues**: The transient nature of the property could cause race conditions 3. **Poor separation of concerns**: Data objects shouldn't control their own serialization behavior  ## Solution  ### 1. Added new RLP behavior flag ```csharp ///  /// Skip encoding state root and status code in receipt RLP serialization. /// Used for receipt root calculation when receipts are encoded without state/status information. ///  SkipReceiptStateAndStatus = 256 ```  ### 2. Updated ReceiptsRootCalculator **Before** (unsafe mutation): ```csharp receipts.SetSkipStateAndStatusInRlp(true); try {     return ReceiptTrie.CalculateRoot(spec, receipts, _decoder); } finally {     receipts.SetSkipStateAndStatusInRlp(false); } ```  **After** (clean RLP behavior): ```csharp Hash256 skipStateAndStatusReceiptsRoot = ReceiptTrie.CalculateRoot(spec, receipts, _decoder, RlpBehaviors.SkipReceiptStateAndStatus); ```  ### 3. Enhanced ReceiptTrie with behavior support - Added constructor overload to accept additional RLP behaviors - Added `CalculateRoot` overload that passes behaviors through to encoding - Maintains full backward compatibility  ### 4. Updated all receipt decoders - `ReceiptMessageDecoder`, `ReceiptMessageDecoder69`, `OptimismReceiptMessageDecoder` - Simplified condition from `!item.SkipStateAndStatusInRlp && (rlpBehaviors & RlpBehaviors.SkipReceiptStateAndStatus) == RlpBehaviors.None` - To clean: `(rlpBehaviors & RlpBehaviors.SkipReceiptStateAndStatus) == RlpBehaviors.None`  ### 5. Complete property removal - Removed `SkipStateAndStatusInRlp { get; set; }` from `TxReceipt` - Removed `SetSkipStateAndStatusInRlp` extension method - Updated all related tests  ## Testing  ✅ **All 2182 tests pass**, including new comprehensive test that verifies: - Skip behavior produces shorter encoding than normal - Round-trip decoding works correctly for both normal and skip cases - RLP behavior flag works as expected  ## Benefits  1. **🚫 Eliminated unsafe mutation** - No more ""demon-conjuring"" transient properties 2. **✅ Thread safety** - No more mutable state that could cause race conditions   3. **🔄 Explicit control** - Clear, intentional specification of encoding behavior 4. **🏗️ Better architecture** - Clean separation between data and encoding logic 5. **📦 Cleaner API** - Decision moved to RLP flags as suggested in the issue  Fixes #8588.   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3237862514,Refactor Data API with graceful shutdown and add OpenAPI endpoint,"This PR refactors the Data API listener and handler to implement graceful shutdown and serve the OpenAPI specification, addressing the TODO in the codebase.  ## Changes Made  ### 1. Graceful Shutdown Implementation - **Pattern**: Copied the proven graceful shutdown approach from `/internal/util/debug/debug.go` - **Implementation**: Added `ctxutil.WithDelay()` for 3-second graceful shutdown window - **Error Handling**: Proper error logging for shutdown and close operations - **Logging**: Added ""DataAPI server stopped"" message for consistency with debug handler  ### 2. OpenAPI Endpoint (`GET /openapi.json`) - **Embedding**: Used `go:embed` to include `openapi.json` at build time in the `api` package - **Headers**: Set proper `Content-Type: application/json` and `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` - **Method Validation**: Returns `405 Method Not Allowed` for non-GET requests - **Integration**: Added custom mux to register the endpoint alongside generated API routes  ### 3. Robust Error Handling - **Nil Safety**: Added nil check for handler to prevent panics when handler is not provided - **Graceful Degradation**: OpenAPI endpoint works independently of database connectivity  ## Files Modified  - `internal/dataapi/listener.go`: Added graceful shutdown + OpenAPI endpoint registration - `internal/dataapi/server/server.go`: Added `OpenAPISpec` method - `internal/dataapi/api/gen.go`: Added embedded OpenAPI spec + helper function  ## Tests Added  - **Unit Tests**: `TestOpenAPISpec` in server package using `httptest` - **Integration Tests**: `TestDataAPIEndpoints` testing actual HTTP server - **Coverage**: Validates graceful shutdown, OpenAPI endpoint, method validation, JSON structure  ## Before/After  **Before:** ```go // TODO https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/issues/4848 <-ctx.Done() ```  **After:** ```go <-ctx.Done()  // ctx is already canceled, but we want to inherit its values shutdownCtx, shutdownCancel := ctxutil.WithDelay(ctx) defer shutdownCancel(nil)  if err := srv.Shutdown(shutdownCtx); err != nil {     lis.opts.L.LogAttrs(ctx, logging.LevelDPanic, ""Shutdown exited with unexpected error"", logging.Error(err)) }  if err := srv.Close(); err != nil {     lis.opts.L.LogAttrs(ctx, logging.LevelDPanic, ""Close exited with unexpected error"", logging.Error(err)) }  lis.opts.L.InfoContext(ctx, ""DataAPI server stopped"") ```  ## Verification  ✅ All new tests pass   ✅ Graceful shutdown confirmed via log messages   ✅ OpenAPI endpoint serves valid JSON with correct structure   ✅ Existing functionality preserved   ✅ No compilation errors   ✅ Minimal, surgical changes that follow existing patterns    The implementation follows the same graceful shutdown pattern used by the debug handler, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

3168490257,Remove ActivityDisposable conditional directives and replace with System.IDisposable | null,"This PR removes the conditional compilation directives for `ActivityDisposable` that were needed during the nullness bootstrapping phase when the ""last known good"" compiler had bugs around 'use' and nullable disposable handling.  ## Changes Made  1. **Removed conditional compilation block** from `NullnessShims.fs`:    ```fsharp    // REMOVED:    #if BUILDING_WITH_LKG        type ActivityDisposable = System.IDisposable    #else        type ActivityDisposable = System.IDisposable | null    #endif    ```  2. **Updated function signatures** in `Activity.fs` and `Activity.fsi` to directly use `System.IDisposable | null`:    - `start: name: string -> tags: (string * string) seq -> System.IDisposable | null`    - `startNoTags: name: string -> System.IDisposable | null`    - `startAndMeasureEnvironmentStats: name: string -> System.IDisposable | null`  ## Impact  - Simplifies the codebase by removing conditional compilation complexity - All `ActivityDisposable` references are now directly replaced with `System.IDisposable | null` - No functional changes to behavior - the type alias was already resolving to `System.IDisposable | null` in the non-LKG case - Maintains nullness safety while removing the bootstrapping workaround  The changes are minimal and surgical, affecting only the necessary files to complete the cleanup of the nullness bootstrapping infrastructure.

3217644664,Rename IGetAllScheduleInfo to IGetScheduleInfo,"This PR renames the interface `IGetAllScheduleInfo` to `IGetScheduleInfo` to better reflect its actual purpose and usage.  ## Changes Made  - **Interface Definition**: Renamed `IGetAllScheduleInfo.cs` to `IGetScheduleInfo.cs` - **Interface Name**: Updated interface name from `IGetAllScheduleInfo` to `IGetScheduleInfo` - **Implementation**: Updated `ScheduledEvent.cs` to implement `IGetScheduleInfo` - **Usage**: Updated `Scheduler.cs` to use `IGetScheduleInfo` in the `GetSchedules()` method  ## Rationale  The original name `IGetAllScheduleInfo` was misleading because: - The interface only contains a single method `GetScheduleInfo()` that returns information about **one** schedule - It doesn't provide information about ""all"" schedules - that functionality is handled by the `Scheduler.GetSchedules()` method which calls this interface on individual schedule events - The new name `IGetScheduleInfo` more accurately represents what the interface does  ## Testing  All existing tests continue to pass: - ✅ 1,008 unit tests - ✅ 67 mailer tests   - ✅ 15 integration tests  No breaking changes were introduced as this is purely an internal interface rename.

3115145732,Rename RegisterTestFramework adapterFactory parameter to frameworkFactory,"This PR renames the `adapterFactory` parameter to `frameworkFactory` in the `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.Builder.ITestApplicationBuilder.RegisterTestFramework` public API.  ## Changes Made  - Renamed `adapterFactory` parameter to `frameworkFactory` in `ITestApplicationBuilder.RegisterTestFramework` method signature - Updated XML documentation for the parameter to reflect the new name - Updated the implementation in `TestApplicationBuilder.cs` to use the new parameter name - Updated parameter validation and assignment to use the new name  ## Breaking Change Impact  This is a **code-breaking change** for calls that use the parameter name explicitly (e.g., `frameworkFactory: value`). However, it is **not a binary-breaking change** - all existing code using positional parameters will continue to work without recompilation.  Based on the analysis, major test frameworks (TUnit, NUnit, xUnit.net) do not use named parameters for this method, so the impact is minimal.  ## Rationale  The previous naming `adapterFactory` was leaking implementation details from MSTest's VSTest compatible implementation and did not fit the generic interface semantics. The new name `frameworkFactory` better represents the purpose of this parameter in the generic testing platform context.

3271866532,Remove duplicate project name validation in Aspire CLI - delegate to dotnet new,"Fixes #10629  The Aspire CLI was implementing custom project name validation that duplicated logic already present in the `dotnet new` command. Following architectural feedback, this PR removes the custom validation entirely and delegates all project name validation to the underlying `dotnet new` command.  ## Changes Made  **Removed Custom Validation Logic** - Removed `ProjectNameValidator` class and Unicode-aware regex pattern - Removed validation from `GetProjectNameAsync` in `DotNetTemplateFactory`   - Removed validation from `PromptForProjectNameAsync` in `NewCommand` - Removed comprehensive test suite for project name validation - Cleaned up unnecessary using statements  ## Benefits  - **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminates duplicate validation logic and reduces maintenance burden - **Consistency**: Ensures project name validation is consistent with .NET CLI standards - **Single Source of Truth**: `dotnet new` is the authoritative validator for project names - **Better Error Messages**: Users receive validation errors directly from the .NET CLI  ## Behavior  When users provide project names (including Unicode names like ""项目1"", ""Проект1"", etc.):  1. Aspire CLI passes the name directly to `dotnet new` without pre-validation 2. `dotnet new` validates the name according to its own rules 3. If invalid, `dotnet new` provides appropriate error messages 4. Users can adjust based on the authoritative .NET CLI feedback  This approach follows the principle of avoiding duplicate validation logic while still enabling international project names that `dotnet new` supports.    *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Aspire CLI currently validates project names using a strict ASCII-only regex, which prevents users from creating projects with names in non-Latin scripts (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.).

3173180612,Deprecate SharedTokenCacheCredential and remove from DefaultAzureCredential authentication flow,"This PR deprecates `SharedTokenCacheCredential` and related components as requested in #50694. The `SharedTokenCacheCredential` was originally introduced for interop with Visual Studio, but now that `VisualStudioCredential` exists, it is no longer needed.  ## Changes Made  ### Azure.Identity - **Deprecated `SharedTokenCacheCredential` class** with `[Obsolete]` and `[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]` attributes - **Deprecated `SharedTokenCacheCredentialOptions` class** with appropriate obsolete messaging - **Deprecated `DefaultAzureCredentialOptions.ExcludeSharedTokenCacheCredential` property**  - **Removed `SharedTokenCacheCredential` from `DefaultAzureCredential` authentication flow** - it will no longer be included in the credential chain regardless of the `ExcludeSharedTokenCacheCredential` setting - **Added CHANGELOG entry** in Breaking Changes > Behavioral Breaking Changes section  ### Azure.Identity.Broker - **Deprecated `SharedTokenCacheCredentialBrokerOptions` class** with broker-specific obsolete messaging  ### Test Updates - Updated test expectations to reflect removal from DefaultAzureCredential chain - Removed SharedTokenCacheCredential from credential enumeration tests - All existing SharedTokenCacheCredential-specific tests continue to pass  ## Deprecation Messages - `SharedTokenCacheCredential`: ""This credential is deprecated. Consider using other dev tool credentials, such as VisualStudioCredential."" - `SharedTokenCacheCredentialOptions`: ""SharedTokenCacheCredential is deprecated. Consider using other dev tool credentials, such as VisualStudioCredential."" - `DefaultAzureCredentialOptions.ExcludeSharedTokenCacheCredential`: ""SharedTokenCacheCredential is deprecated. Consider using other dev tool credentials, such as VisualStudioCredential."" - `SharedTokenCacheCredentialBrokerOptions`: ""SharedTokenCacheCredential is deprecated. For brokered authentication, consider using InteractiveBrowserCredential.""  ## Behavioral Changes This is a **behavioral breaking change**. `SharedTokenCacheCredential` is no longer part of the `DefaultAzureCredential` authentication flow, even when `ExcludeSharedTokenCacheCredential` is set to `false`. Users relying on this credential should migrate to `VisualStudioCredential` or other dev tool credentials.  The `SharedTokenCacheCredential` class itself remains functional for direct usage until it is fully removed in a future release.

3265728197,Refactor RZInput: Replace singleton pattern with static functions for multi-device support,"This PR refactors the RZInput system to eliminate the cumbersome singleton-based virtual interface pattern and replaces it with a clean static function design similar to RZFileSystem. This change significantly simplifies the architecture and makes it much easier to extend support for complex HID devices like PS5 DualSense controllers and Xbox gamepads.  ## Changes Made  ### Core Architecture Changes - **Removed singleton pattern**: Eliminated `s_Instance` and the need for `SelectGLFWInputManager()` - **Removed virtual interface**: No more virtual methods or inheritance hierarchy - **Static function implementation**: All input methods are now direct static calls  ### Platform-Specific Implementation The new implementation uses preprocessor directives to select the appropriate platform backend:  ```cpp #if defined(RAZIX_USE_GLFW_WINDOWS) || defined(RAZIX_PLATFORM_MACOS) || defined(RAZIX_PLATFORM_UNIX)     // GLFW implementation for cross-platform support     bool RZInput::IsKeyPressed(Razix::KeyCode::Key keycode) {         auto window = GetActiveWindow();         int keyState = glfwGetKey(window, int(keycode));         return keyState == GLFW_PRESS;     } #elif defined(RAZIX_PLATFORM_WINDOWS)     // Windows native implementation (placeholder for future enhancement)     bool RZInput::IsKeyPressed(Razix::KeyCode::Key keycode) {         // TODO: Implement Windows-specific input         return false;     } #endif ```  ### API Compatibility The public API remains completely unchanged, ensuring all existing code continues to work:  ```cpp // Before and after - same API if (RZInput::IsKeyPressed(KeyCode::Key::W)) { /* move forward */ } if (RZInput::IsGamepadConnected()) { /* use gamepad */ } f32 stickX = RZInput::GetJoyLeftStickHorizontal(); ```  ### Benefits for Multi-Device Support - **Easier extension**: Adding new device types (PS5 DualSense, Xbox controllers) now requires just adding new methods and platform-specific implementations - **No dynamic switching overhead**: Compile-time platform selection improves performance - **Cleaner codebase**: Removed complex inheritance hierarchy and singleton management - **Better maintainability**: Direct static calls are easier to debug and trace  ### Platform Initialization Cleanup Updated platform OS initialization code to remove the now-unnecessary input manager selection:  ```cpp // Before RZInput::SelectGLFWInputManager(); Razix::RZInput* Razix::RZInput::s_Instance = new WindowsInput();  // After   // Input system now uses static functions with platform-specific implementations ```  ### Backward Compatibility - All existing `RZInput::` calls in Camera3D.cpp and RZApplication.cpp work unchanged - GLFWInput files are marked as deprecated but preserved for compatibility - No breaking changes to the public interface  This refactoring provides a solid foundation for implementing advanced input features like haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and motion controls that are essential for modern gaming devices.

3104249084,Refactor ServiceBusProcessor to use fixed concurrency model,"## Overview  This PR refactors the `ServiceBusProcessor` to use a fixed concurrency model where the number of `ReceiverManager` instances is determined at construction time and cannot be changed dynamically during runtime.  ## Problem  The current `ServiceBusProcessor` implementation allows dynamic adjustment of the number of `ReceiverManager` instances through methods like `ReconcileConcurrencyAsync` and `UpdateConcurrency`. This adds complexity to the codebase and can lead to unpredictable behavior during runtime.  ## Solution  - **Fixed Initialization**: `ReceiverManager` instances are now created at construction time based on the processor configuration - **Removed Dynamic Adjustment**: Methods that dynamically adjust concurrency now throw `NotSupportedException` - **Simplified Reconciliation**: The reconciliation logic now only initializes semaphores once instead of continuously adjusting receiver counts - **Maintained API Compatibility**: Existing methods are preserved but throw exceptions to prevent usage  ## Key Changes  ### ServiceBusProcessor.cs - Added `InitializeFixedReceiverManagers()` method called from constructor - Made `UpdateConcurrency` methods throw `NotSupportedException` with `[Obsolete]` attribute - Simplified `ReconcileConcurrencyAsync` to only initialize semaphores once - Removed `ReconcileReceiverManagers` method (logic moved to constructor) - Updated class and property documentation to reflect fixed concurrency model  ### Tests - Updated unit tests to verify that `UpdateConcurrency` methods throw exceptions - Modified live tests to validate fixed concurrency behavior - Converted dynamic concurrency tests to test fixed behavior instead  ## Before/After Behavior  **Before:** ```csharp var processor = client.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions  {      MaxConcurrentCalls = 5  }); await processor.StartProcessingAsync();  // This would dynamically change concurrency processor.UpdateConcurrency(10); // Would work ```  **After:** ```csharp var processor = client.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions  {      MaxConcurrentCalls = 5  }); await processor.StartProcessingAsync();  // This now throws NotSupportedException processor.UpdateConcurrency(10); // Throws exception ```  ## Impact  - **Breaking Change**: Applications using `UpdateConcurrency` methods will need to set the desired concurrency at construction time - **Performance**: More predictable performance characteristics with fixed receiver count - **Simplicity**: Reduced code complexity by removing dynamic adjustment logic - **Compatibility**: `UpdatePrefetchCount` still works as it doesn't affect receiver count  ## Files Changed  - `ServiceBusProcessor.cs`: Core implementation changes (88 additions, 148 deletions) - Test files: Updated to test fixed behavior (45 additions, 79 deletions)  **Net result**: 94 lines of code removed while implementing the new fixed concurrency model.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `4m6vsblobprodcus384.vsblob.vsassets.io` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build src/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.csproj ` (dns block) > - `4myvsblobprodcus32.vsblob.vsassets.io` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build src/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.csproj ` (dns block) > - `5rqvsblobprodcus385.vsblob.vsassets.io` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build src/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.csproj ` (dns block) > - `frdvsblobprodcus327.vsblob.vsassets.io` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build src/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.csproj ` (dns block) > - `nn8vsblobprodcus340.vsblob.vsassets.io` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build src/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.csproj ` (dns block) > - `pe3vsblobprodcus354.vsblob.vsassets.io` >   - Triggering command: `dotnet build src/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.csproj ` (dns block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config) > >    ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3186777284,Refactor CLI parsing to separate syntax parsing from option validation,"## Problem  The current `parse_cli` functionality performs both CLI syntax parsing and option existence validation, which requires loading the full FFmpeg options dictionary. This increases package size because the complete options list gets bundled into release files.  ## Solution  This PR refactors the CLI parsing to separate these concerns:  ### New Functions - **`parse_cli(cli: str)`** - Parses CLI arguments by syntax only, without loading the options dictionary - **`parse_with_validation(cli: str, validate_options: bool)`** - Allows explicit control over validation behavior  ### Modified Functions - **`parse_global()`, `parse_input()`, `parse_output()`** - Made `ffmpeg_options` parameter optional - **`parse_filter_complex()`** - Updated to handle optional filter validation - **`parse_options()`** - Already only handled syntax parsing (no changes needed)  ### Backward Compatibility The original `parse()` function remains unchanged and continues to validate options by default.  ## Usage Examples  ### Before (loads full options dictionary) ```python from ffmpeg.compile.compile_cli import parse stream = parse(""ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 output.mp4"") ```  ### After (syntax-only parsing, no dictionary loading) ```python from ffmpeg.compile.compile_cli import parse_cli stream = parse_cli(""ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 output.mp4"") ```  ### Explicit validation control ```python from ffmpeg.compile.compile_cli import parse_with_validation  # No validation (smaller package size) stream = parse_with_validation(cli, validate_options=False)  # With validation (backward compatible) stream = parse_with_validation(cli, validate_options=True) ```  ## Benefits  1. **Reduced Package Size** - `parse_cli()` avoids loading the full options dictionary 2. **Improved Performance** - Faster parsing without validation overhead 3. **Flexible Validation** - Can enable/disable validation as needed 4. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing code continues to work unchanged  ## Testing  - ✅ Comprehensive unit tests verify dictionary loading behavior - ✅ Compatibility tests ensure both parsing methods work correctly - ✅ Complex CLI commands with filters tested successfully - ✅ Mocking confirms `parse_cli()` doesn't load options dictionary - ✅ All existing functionality preserved  Fixes #741   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3186828591,Refactor CLI parsing to decouple syntax parsing from option validation,"Addresses #743 by refactoring `compile_cli.parse` and related parsing functions to separate CLI syntax parsing from option existence validation, enabling package size reduction and more flexible usage scenarios.  ## Changes Made  ### New Syntax-Only Parsing Functions - `parse_input_syntax()` - Parse input file specifications without validation - `parse_output_syntax()` - Parse output file specifications without validation   - `parse_global_syntax()` - Parse global options without validation - Enhanced `parse_options()` - Pure syntax parsing with improved documentation  ### New Validation Utilities - `validate_parsed_options()` - Validate parsed options against FFmpeg options dictionary - `validate_input_options()` - Context-specific validation for input options - `validate_output_options()` - Context-specific validation for output options - `validate_global_options()` - Context-specific validation for global options  ### Enhanced Existing Functions - `parse()` - Added optional `validate` parameter (default `True` for backward compatibility) - `parse_input()`, `parse_output()`, `parse_global()` - Added validation control parameters  ## Key Benefits  ### 1. Backward Compatibility All existing code continues to work unchanged: ```python # This still works exactly as before stream = parse(""ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 output.mp4"") ```  ### 2. Package Size Reduction Parse-only mode doesn't require the bundled options dictionary: ```python # Enables package size reduction by not loading options data stream = parse(""ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 output.mp4"", validate=False) ```  ### 3. Flexible Validation Validation can be deferred or customized: ```python # Parse first, validate later with custom logic parsed_options = parse_options([""-vcodec"", ""libx264"", ""-custom"", ""value""]) # Apply custom validation as needed validated = validate_output_options(parsed_options) ```  ### 4. Unknown Option Preservation Parse-only mode preserves custom/unknown options: ```python # With validation=False, custom options are preserved cmd = ""ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -custom_option value output.mp4"" stream = parse(cmd, validate=False) compiled = compile(stream)  # Includes -custom_option value ```  ## Testing  - **23 new comprehensive tests** covering all new functionality - **All 45 existing tests** still pass, ensuring backward compatibility - **Package size reduction scenarios** tested and verified - **Complex integration cases** validated  ## Documentation  Added complete documentation (`docs/cli_parsing_decoupling.md`) with: - Usage examples for all new functions - Migration guide for existing code - Performance considerations - Future enhancement roadmap  ## Example Usage  ```python from ffmpeg.compile.compile_cli import parse, parse_options, validate_output_options  # Parse without validation (package size reduction) stream = parse(""ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 output.mp4"", validate=False)  # Low-level syntax parsing options = parse_options([""-vcodec"", ""libx264"", ""-b:v"", ""1000k""]) # Result: {""vcodec"": [""libx264""], ""b:v"": [""1000k""]}  # Separate validation step validated = validate_output_options(options) # Result: {""vcodec"": ""libx264"", ""b:v"": ""1000k""} ```  This refactor maintains complete backward compatibility while enabling new use cases that weren't previously possible, particularly for applications that need parsing without the overhead of loading and validating against the full FFmpeg options dictionary.   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3229189997,Refactor IPC constants to use namespaced objects for better organization,"## Summary  This PR refactors the IPC (Inter-Process Communication) constants structure from individual string exports to organized namespaced objects, significantly improving code maintainability, developer experience, and IDE support.  ## Problem  The current implementation used hardcoded string literals throughout the codebase:  ```typescript // Before - hardcoded strings scattered everywhere ipcRenderer.sendSync('read-file', filepath) ipcRenderer.send('main-window-set-mode', mode) ipcMain.on('config-load', (event) => { ... }) ```  This approach had several issues: - **Poor organization** - Related IPC signals weren't grouped together - **No IDE support** - No autocomplete or type safety - **Error prone** - Easy to make typos in signal names - **Hard to maintain** - Signal names scattered across multiple files - **Difficult refactoring** - Changing a signal name required finding all occurrences  ## Solution  Created a comprehensive `src/ipc_consts.ts` file with **29 logical namespaces** containing **119 total constants**:  ```typescript // After - organized namespaced constants export const FILE = {   READ_FILE: 'read-file',   SAVE_FILE: 'save-file',   DOWNLOAD: 'download',   // ... more file operations } as const;  export const CONFIG = {   LOAD: 'config-load',   SAVE: 'config-save',   GET_LOCALE_UI: 'config-get-locale-ui',   // ... more config operations } as const; ```  Updated usage throughout the codebase:  ```typescript // New usage pattern with full IDE support import * as IPC from './ipc_consts';  ipcRenderer.sendSync(IPC.FILE.READ_FILE, filepath) ipcRenderer.send(IPC.MAIN_WINDOW.SET_MODE, mode)   ipcMain.on(IPC.CONFIG.LOAD, (event) => { ... }) ```  ## Key Namespaces Added  - **APP** - General app operations (get-app-path, set-appearance-theme, etc.) - **MAIN_WINDOW** - Main window operations - **DEBUG** - Debug and developer tools - **FILE** - File system operations (14 constants) - **CONFIG** - Configuration management - **MCP** - Model Context Protocol (12 constants) - **COMPUTER** - Computer control operations - **MEMORY** - Memory management - **AGENTS** - AI agent operations - And 20 more logical groupings...  ## Benefits  ✅ **Better Organization** - Related IPC signals logically grouped together   ✅ **IDE Autocomplete** - Full IntelliSense support for all IPC signals   ✅ **Type Safety** - TypeScript const assertions prevent typos   ✅ **Centralized Management** - All IPC signals defined in one place   ✅ **Easy Refactoring** - Change signal names in single location   ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Exact same string values maintained    ## Validation  - **119 IPC constants** successfully converted across both files - **Zero breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved - **Comprehensive testing** - Validated string compatibility and usage patterns - **No hardcoded strings** remaining (excluding legitimate Electron app events)  ## Files Changed  - `src/ipc_consts.ts` - New constants file with namespaced organization - `src/preload.ts` - Updated to use `IPC.NAMESPACE.CONSTANT` pattern - `src/main.ts` - Updated to use `IPC.NAMESPACE.CONSTANT` pattern  This refactoring significantly improves the developer experience while maintaining full backward compatibility and adding robust type safety to the IPC communication layer.  *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Update the IPC constants structure to use namespaced objects instead of individual exports. >  > ## Current Issue > The current implementation in the PR exports individual constants like: > ```typescript > export const READ_FILE = 'read-file';

3269759400,Obsolete ParameterResource.Value property with suppressions for migration,"This PR marks the `ParameterResource.Value` property as obsolete to prepare for migration to the async `GetValueAsync` method. This is the first phase of the migration strategy where we identify all usages and suppress the obsolete warnings to maintain a working build state.  ## Changes Made  ### Core Change - Marked `ParameterResource.Value` property as `[Obsolete]` with updated XML documentation recommending migration to `GetValueAsync` or direct `ParameterResource` usage - Used warning-level obsolete (not `error: true`) since error-level obsolete attributes cannot be suppressed with pragma directives  ### Suppressions Added Added `#pragma warning disable CS0618` suppressions in the following files: - `src/Aspire.Hosting.Docker/DockerComposeServiceExtensions.cs` - Parameter default value handling - `src/Aspire.Hosting.Kubernetes/KubernetesServiceResourceExtensions.cs` - Helm value resolution   - `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/AddParameterTests.cs` - Multiple test assertions - `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/Orchestrator/ParameterProcessorTests.cs` - Parameter processor validation - `tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/DistributedApplicationTests.cs` - Redis connection string tests  ### Special Case - `src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure/AzurePublishingContext.cs` - Used project-level `CS0618` suppression due to refactored helper method approach  ## Migration Strategy  This PR represents **Phase 1** of the migration: 1. ✅ **Mark obsolete and suppress** (this PR) 2. 🔄 **Review and migrate appropriate usages** (future work) 3. 🔄 **Remove obsolete property** (future work)  The suppressions ensure the build continues to work while we plan the migration strategy for each usage. Some usages may be appropriate for `GetValueAsync` migration, while others might need different approaches.  ## Testing  All individual projects build successfully with the obsolete warnings properly suppressed. The functionality remains unchanged - this is purely a preparatory step for the async migration.  Fixes #10362 Related to #10354, #10359, #10361    *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Obsolete the ParameterResource.Value property throughout the codebase. In this first pass: > - Mark ParameterResource.Value as [Obsolete] with an error flag (causing compile errors). > - Introduce suppressions (pragma, #nullable, or similar) wherever the compile error is triggered, so the build continues to succeed. > - Do NOT attempt to change usages to GetValueAsync yet; only suppress the errors for now. > - Update XML documentation to indicate that Value is obsolete and recommend using GetValueAsync or direct ParameterResource usage instead. > - Do not change any usage to GetValueAsync in this PR, only suppress errors and mark obsolete. > - Touch documentation and code comments as needed to provide migration guidance. >  > This is the first pass for the planned migration.

3185241769,Remove IVisualTreeElementProvidable interface and related code,"> [!NOTE] > Are you waiting for the changes in this PR to be merged? > It would be very helpful if you could [test the resulting artifacts](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/Testing-PR-Builds) from this PR and let us know in a comment if this change resolves your issue. Thank you!  ## Description  This PR removes the `IVisualTreeElementProvidable` interface and all related code as requested in issue #30295. The interface was originally designed to help search through the platform tree to locate corresponding `IView` elements, but it was never actually needed or used in practice.  ## Changes Made  - **Deleted** `src/Core/src/Core/IVisualTreeElementProvidable.cs` interface file - **Updated** platform-specific classes to remove interface inheritance:   - `LayoutViewGroup` (Android)   - `ContentViewGroup` (Android)    - `MauiPanel` (Windows)   - `MauiView` (iOS) - **Modified** `VisualTreeElementExtensions.GetVisualTreeElement()` method to return null since the search logic relied on the removed interface - **Removed** the unused `FindNextChild` helper method  ## Impact  - **145 lines of code removed**, **7 lines added** - No breaking changes to public APIs - Build compiles successfully across all platforms - Existing unit tests continue to pass  The removal of this unused interface simplifies the codebase and eliminates dead code that was never actually utilized in the visual tree search functionality.

3128663211,Refactor mod selection system to use object references instead of selectedIndex,"## Summary  This PR completely refactors the mod and submod selection system in both the HTML/JavaScript mod editor and C# MainWindow_ModManager to eliminate the use of `selectedIndex`. The new object-based approach ensures correct mod/submod selection regardless of UI sorting, filtering, or reordering operations.  ## Problem  The existing system used `selectedIndex` to track which mod/submod was currently selected, which caused critical bugs:  ```javascript // PROBLEMATIC: selectedIndex changes after sorting const modIndex = modSelect.prop('selectedIndex');  // Points to wrong mod after sorting const targetElement = mods[modIndex];              // Edits wrong mod! ```  **Issues with selectedIndex:** 1. **UI Sorting/Filtering**: When mods are sorted by name/author, `selectedIndex=1` might point to ""ModA"" before sorting but ""ModZ"" after sorting 2. **XML Position Mismatch**: `selectedIndex` reflects UI position, but XML operations need original document position   3. **Collection Modifications**: Move operations and add/remove operations invalidate existing indices 4. **Concurrency**: Form changes save automatically, but if selection changes during typing, wrong mod gets updated  ## Solution  Replaced `selectedIndex` with stable object references combined with `originalIndex` for XML operations:  ### Object-Based Selection System  ```javascript // NEW APPROACH: Stable object references let selectedMod = null;        // Direct reference to selected mod DOM element   let selectedSubMod = null;     // Direct reference to selected submod (null for main mod)  // Selection remains stable regardless of UI sorting function saveToXmlElement() {     const targetElement = selectedSubMod || selectedMod;  // Always correct mod     // ... save to correct element } ```  ### OriginalIndex for XML Operations  ```javascript // For XML operations, use originalIndex assigned during parsing function findByOriginalIndex(modList, originalIndex) {     return modList.find(mod => mod.originalIndex === originalIndex); }  // This always finds the correct XML element regardless of UI state const xmlElement = findByOriginalIndex(sortedMods, selectedMod.originalIndex); ```  ## Changes Made  ### HTML/JavaScript Mod Editor (`index.html`) - ✅ Added `selectedMod` and `selectedSubMod` tracking variables - ✅ Refactored `saveToXmlElement()` to use object references instead of `selectedIndex` - ✅ Updated selection handlers (`updateSubmods()`, submod change handler) to store object references - ✅ Modified `selectModInUI()` to use `originalIndex` for stable identification - ✅ Enhanced new mod/submod creation to properly handle object references - ✅ Added comprehensive comments explaining why `selectedIndex` cannot be used  ### C# WPF Application (`MainWindow_ModManager.cs`) - ✅ Added `selectedMod` and `selectedSubMod` properties to track current selection - ✅ Refactored movement operations (up/down/top/bottom) to use object references - ✅ Updated selection handlers (`OnModListSelect`, `CheckBox_Click`, `SubMod_CheckChanged`) - ✅ Added helper methods for finding mods by `OriginalIndex` - ✅ Enhanced all mod interaction methods to maintain object references  ### Infrastructure (`Mod.cs`) - ✅ Utilized existing `OriginalIndex` property and helper methods - ✅ Used existing `FindByOriginalIndex()` and `FindSubModByOriginalIndex()` methods - ✅ Leveraged `GetNextModOriginalIndex()` for proper new mod/submod creation  ## Testing  Created comprehensive tests that verify: - ✅ Object references remain stable after sorting by name/author - ✅ `originalIndex` always finds correct XML elements in any sorted order - ✅ System works correctly for both mods and submods - ✅ Collection modifications don't break selection - ✅ New mod/submod creation assigns correct `originalIndex` values  ## Benefits  ### 🛡️ Bug Prevention - **Stable Selection**: Selection remains correct after sorting, filtering, or reordering - **Reliable Saves**: Form edits always target the intended mod/submod - **Consistent XML Operations**: Save operations always target correct XML elements  ### 🚀 Enhanced Robustness   - **Future-Proof**: System immune to UI enhancements (sorting, filtering, searching) - **Move Operations**: Moving mods up/down works correctly regardless of current state - **No Side Effects**: Operations don't affect other mod indices  ### 🔧 Maintainability - **Clear Architecture**: Object references provide intuitive, stable selection model - **Comprehensive Comments**: Detailed explanations of why `selectedIndex` fails and how new system works - **Easy Extension**: Adding new selection-based features is straightforward  ## Compatibility  - ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Maintains full compatibility with existing functionality - ✅ **User Experience**: No changes to user interface or interaction patterns   - ✅ **New Mod Support**: Adding new mods/submods works reliably with proper `originalIndex` assignment - ✅ **XML Integrity**: All existing XML operations continue to work correctly  ## Example: Before vs After  **Before (Problematic):** ```javascript // User selects ""Beatrix Enhancement"" (index 2 in original list) const modIndex = 2; // User sorts by name alphabetically   // Index 2 now points to ""Moguri Mod"" instead! saveToXmlElement(); // ❌ Saves to wrong mod ```  **After (Correct):** ```javascript // User selects ""Beatrix Enhancement""  selectedMod = beatrixEnhancementElement; // User sorts by name alphabetically // selectedMod still points to Beatrix Enhancement saveToXmlElement(); // ✅ Always saves to correct mod ```  This refactoring eliminates a significant class of selection-related bugs while maintaining full backward compatibility and improving the overall robustness of the mod management system.  ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3259414954,Refactor convertFromMongoDb to handle $and/$or operators in separate method,"This PR refactors the `convertFromMongoDb` method in the MongoDB import module to improve code organization by extracting the `$and`/`$or` operator handling logic into a separate method.  ## Changes Made  - **Extracted logical operator handling**: Created a new `handleLogicalOperators(mongoQuery, config)` method that specifically handles `$and` and `$or` operators - **Simplified main method**: Updated `convertFromMongoDb` to call the new method first, then fall back to field-level query handling - **Maintained functionality**: All existing behavior is preserved with no breaking changes  ## Code Structure Before/After  **Before:** ```javascript function convertFromMongoDb(mongoQuery, config) {   const errors = [];    // Handle $and/$or at root (25+ lines of logic)   for (const conjKey of [""$and"", ""$or""]) {     // ... complex logic mixed with other concerns   }    // Handle field-level queries   // ... rest of the method } ```  **After:** ```javascript function handleLogicalOperators(mongoQuery, config) {   // Dedicated method for $and/$or handling   // Clean separation of concerns }  function convertFromMongoDb(mongoQuery, config) {   // Handle $and/$or operators   const [logicalTree, logicalErrors] = handleLogicalOperators(mongoQuery, config);   if (logicalTree) {     return [logicalTree, [...errors, ...logicalErrors]];   }    // Handle field-level queries   // ... rest of the method } ```  ## Benefits  - **Better code organization**: Logical operators are now handled in a dedicated, focused method - **Improved maintainability**: Each method has a single, clear responsibility - **Enhanced readability**: The main method is cleaner and easier to follow - **Future extensibility**: The separated method can be easily extended or tested independently  ## Testing  All existing tests continue to pass (5/5), confirming that the refactoring maintains identical functionality: - ✅ Simple equality queries - ✅ Operator queries (`$gt`, `$lt`, etc.) - ✅ `$and` operator handling - ✅ `$or` operator handling   - ✅ Between queries (`$gte` + `$lte`) - ✅ Regex queries  The changes are minimal (14 lines added, 1 removed) and surgical, focusing only on the code organization improvement without affecting any existing behavior.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > -

3211119439,Refactor AzureApiFactory and related factories into shared Octoshift project,"This PR eliminates code duplication by moving shared factory classes from project-specific folders to the shared Octoshift project.  ## Problem The following factories were duplicated across both `bbs2gh` and `gei` projects with identical implementations: - `AzureApiFactory` and `IAzureApiFactory` - `BlobServiceClientFactory` and `IBlobServiceClientFactory`  - `AwsApiFactory`  This duplication made maintenance difficult and violated DRY principles.  ## Solution - **Moved shared factories to `src/Octoshift/Factories/`:**   - `IAzureApiFactory.cs` - Interface for Azure API factory   - `AzureApiFactory.cs` - Implementation for Azure API factory   - `IBlobServiceClientFactory.cs` - Interface for blob service client factory   - `BlobServiceClientFactory.cs` - Implementation for blob service client factory   - `AwsApiFactory.cs` - Implementation for AWS API factory  - **Updated import statements** in test files and command files to reference shared factories - **Removed duplicate factory files** from `src/gei/Factories/` and `src/bbs2gh/Factories/`  ## Verification - ✅ All 899 tests pass with no regressions - ✅ No compilation errors - ✅ Both CLI applications (`gei` and `bbs2gh`) run successfully - ✅ Code formatted with `dotnet format`  The dependency injection registrations in both projects automatically pick up the shared implementations since they register by interface type.

3209906078,Refactor ChatMCP policy key to follow layering and import rules,"## Problem  The ChatMCP policy key was hardcoded as string literals in multiple places, violating layering principles and creating duplication:  - `src/vs/workbench/services/policies/common/accountPolicyService.ts` contained `key === 'ChatMCP'` - `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/chat.contribution.ts` contained `name: 'ChatMCP'`  This approach had several issues: 1. **No single source of truth** - the same string literal was duplicated across files 2. **Maintenance burden** - changes to the policy key would require updating multiple locations 3. **Layering violation potential** - higher-level modules contained hardcoded values that should be shared  ## Solution  Created a new shared module `src/vs/platform/policy/common/policyKeys.ts` that defines policy keys as constants:  ```typescript /**  * Policy key for controlling Chat MCP (Model Context Protocol) functionality.  */ export const CHAT_MCP_POLICY_KEY = 'ChatMCP'; ```  Updated both consuming modules to import and use this shared constant:  - `accountPolicyService.ts`: `else if (key === CHAT_MCP_POLICY_KEY)` - `chat.contribution.ts`: `name: CHAT_MCP_POLICY_KEY`  ## Benefits  ✅ **Single source of truth** - policy key defined once in shared location   ✅ **Layering compliance** - platform module (lower layer) exports to workbench modules (higher layer)   ✅ **No circular dependencies** - platform doesn't import from workbench   ✅ **Maintainability** - future policy key changes only need to be made in one place   ✅ **Type safety** - compile-time verification of key usage    ## Verification  - Confirmed no remaining hardcoded 'ChatMCP' strings exist in the codebase (except the single definition) - Verified import paths follow correct layering (platform → workbench) - Ensured no circular dependencies are introduced - Validated that the policy mechanism continues to work as expected  This refactoring maintains all existing functionality while establishing a proper foundation for policy key management that can be extended for future policy additions.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `electronjs.org` >   - Triggering command: `node-gyp` (dns block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config) > >   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3209908234,Refactor ChatMCP policy to use centralized registry,"## Problem  The `ChatMCP` policy key was duplicated across two locations in the codebase: - `src/vs/workbench/services/policies/common/accountPolicyService.ts` (line 78): hardcoded string `'ChatMCP'` - `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/chat.contribution.ts` (line 262): hardcoded policy object `{ name: 'ChatMCP', minimumVersion: '1.99' }`  This duplication creates maintenance issues and violates the DRY principle.  ## Solution  Created a centralized policy registry to serve as a single source of truth for policy definitions:  **New centralized registry:** ```typescript // src/vs/platform/policy/common/policyRegistry.ts export const PolicyKeys = {     ChatMCP: {         name: 'ChatMCP',         minimumVersion: '1.99',         description: 'Controls whether Model Context Protocol integration is enabled for chat'     } as const } as const; ```  **Updated references:** ```typescript // accountPolicyService.ts - BEFORE else if (key === 'ChatMCP') {  // accountPolicyService.ts - AFTER   else if (key === PolicyKeys.ChatMCP.name) { ```  ```typescript // chat.contribution.ts - BEFORE policy: {     name: 'ChatMCP',     minimumVersion: '1.99', }  // chat.contribution.ts - AFTER policy: {     name: PolicyKeys.ChatMCP.name,     minimumVersion: PolicyKeys.ChatMCP.minimumVersion, } ```  ## Benefits  - ✅ **Eliminates duplication**: Single source of truth for policy definitions - ✅ **Improves maintainability**: Changes to policy metadata only need to be made in one place - ✅ **Follows layering rules**: Platform-level registry imported by workbench-level modules - ✅ **Type safety**: Centralized registry provides better IntelliSense and type checking - ✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new policies to the registry in the future  ## Testing  Added comprehensive test coverage: - New tests for the policy registry functionality - Enhanced account policy service tests to verify ChatMCP policy behavior - Verified no regressions in existing functionality  ## Files Changed  - **New**: `src/vs/platform/policy/common/policyRegistry.ts` - Central policy registry - **New**: `src/vs/platform/policy/test/common/policyRegistry.test.ts` - Registry tests - **Updated**: `src/vs/workbench/services/policies/common/accountPolicyService.ts` - Use registry - **Updated**: `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/chat.contribution.ts` - Use registry - **Enhanced**: `src/vs/workbench/services/policies/test/common/accountPolicyService.test.ts` - Added ChatMCP tests  The refactor maintains backward compatibility while eliminating technical debt and improving code organization.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `electronjs.org` >   - Triggering command: `node-gyp` (dns block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config) > >   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3247852290,Remove dev10 related code from Toolset class,"This PR removes ancient dev10 (Visual Studio 2010) related code from the Toolset class to reduce complexity and eliminate unsupported legacy code.  ## Changes Made  - **Removed dev10 registry detection**: Eliminated all registry key constants and the `Dev10IsInstalled` property that checked for Visual Studio 2010 installations - **Simplified subtoolset selection**: Removed the special case workaround for ToolsVersion ""4.0"" that returned a hardcoded ""10.0"" value when dev10 was detected - **Updated subtoolset logic**: The `ComputeDefaultSubToolsetVersion()` method now consistently picks the highest available subtoolset version numerically - **Cleaned up constants**: Removed `Dev10SubToolsetValue` constant from `Constants.cs` - **Updated tests**: Modified unit tests to expect the new consistent behavior instead of dev10-specific logic - **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up unnecessary `Microsoft.Win32` using directive  ## Files Modified  - `src/Build/Definition/Toolset.cs` - Core logic changes - `src/Build/Resources/Constants.cs` - Removed constant - `src/Build.UnitTests/Definition/Toolset_Tests.cs` - Updated test expectations - `src/Build.UnitTests/Evaluation/Evaluator_Tests.cs` - Updated test and comments  ## Behavior Change  **Before**: ToolsVersion ""4.0"" would return ""10.0"" as the default subtoolset if dev10 was detected via registry, otherwise it would pick the highest available subtoolset.  **After**: All toolsets consistently pick the highest available subtoolset version, removing the dev10 special case entirely.  This change simplifies the codebase by removing detection logic for an unsupported Visual Studio version while maintaining consistent subtoolset selection behavior.

3225420842,Add context to ONNX checker ValidationError messages for better debugging,"When the ONNX checker throws ValidationError about missing fields, it previously provided unclear error messages that made it difficult for users to locate the problematic component in their model.  ## Problem Error messages like this were not helpful for debugging: ``` ValidationError: Field 'shape' of 'type' is required but missing. ```  Users had no way to know which specific input, output, initializer, or function in their model had the missing field.  ## Solution Enhanced the ONNX checker to add contextual information using the existing `ValidationError::AppendContext` mechanism. Error messages now include specific information about which component has the validation issue.  ## Changes Made  - **Graph inputs**: Added context showing which input has validation issues - **Graph outputs**: Added context showing which output has validation issues   - **Initializers**: Added context showing which tensor initializer has validation issues - **Sparse initializers**: Added context showing which sparse tensor has validation issues - **Functions**: Added context showing which function has validation issues  ## Example Improvement  **Before:** ``` ValidationError: Field 'shape' of 'type' is required but missing. ```  **After:** ``` ValidationError: Field 'shape' of 'type' is required but missing.  ==> Context: Bad input specification for input. Name: my_problematic_input ```  ## Implementation The changes follow the existing error handling pattern used elsewhere in the checker, wrapping validation calls with `ONNX_TRY`/`ONNX_CATCH` blocks that use `ValidationError::AppendContext` to add helpful context information.  ## Impact - **Improved debugging experience**: Users can immediately identify which component needs fixing - **No breaking changes**: Error types and core messages remain the same - **Minimal performance overhead**: Exception handling only activates when errors occur  This enhancement significantly improves the developer experience when working with invalid ONNX models by providing actionable error messages.

3157816556,Refactor Store.Query to Return Raft Index for Strong Consistency Reads,"This PR refactors `Store.Query()` to return a Raft index for strong-consistency reads, making it consistent with `Store.Execute()` and `Store.Request()` methods. Previously, clients could not obtain the Raft log index for strong read queries via the HTTP API.  ## Changes Made  ### Core Store Changes - **Updated `Store.Query()` signature** from `(rows, error)` to `(rows, raftIndex, error)` - **STRONG consistency queries** now return the actual Raft log index (`af.Index()`) - **WEAK/NONE consistency queries** return index `0` (since they don't go through Raft)  ### HTTP Layer Integration - **Updated `handleQuery`** to capture the raft index from `Store.Query()` - **Added raft_index support** in JSON responses when `?raft_index=true` query parameter is provided - **Maintains backward compatibility** - raft_index is only included when explicitly requested  ### Cluster Layer Updates - **Updated cluster service** to populate `raftIndex` in `CommandQueryResponse` - **Updated cluster client** `Query()` method to return the raft index from remote queries - **Proper forwarding** of raft index from leader to followers  ### Interface Updates - Updated `Database` interfaces in both `http` and `cluster` packages - All mock implementations updated to match new signatures  ## Example Usage  ```go // Strong consistency query returns non-zero raft index qr.Level = proto.QueryRequest_QUERY_REQUEST_LEVEL_STRONG rows, raftIndex, err := store.Query(qr) // raftIndex will be > 0 for strong reads  // Weak/None consistency queries return 0 qr.Level = proto.QueryRequest_QUERY_REQUEST_LEVEL_WEAK   rows, raftIndex, err := store.Query(qr) // raftIndex will be 0 ```  HTTP API with raft_index parameter: ```bash curl ""http://localhost:4001/db/query?q=SELECT * FROM foo&level=strong&raft_index=true"" ```  Response includes raft index: ```json {   ""results"": [...],   ""raft_index"": 42 } ```  ## Testing - Added `Test_StoreQueryRaftIndex` to verify correct raft index behavior - Updated all existing tests to handle the new 3-value return signature - All store, cluster, and system tests pass  This change enables clients to implement client-side caching strategies and ensure read-after-write consistency by tracking Raft commit indexes for strong consistency reads.

Added schema name braces for consistent path formatting Updated all path assertions to wrap schema names in braces for better clarity: ```kotlin // Before assertThat(paths).containsExactly(""User.data"") assertThat(paths).containsExactly(""Person.officeAddress{AddressRef}"")  // After   assertThat(paths).containsExactly(""{User}.data{string}"") assertThat(paths).containsExactly(""{Person}.officeAddress{AddressRef}"") ```  ### 3. Added scalar type information using Grammar.builtInPatterns Enhanced scalar type identification by adding type annotations in braces: - `{string}` for `StringPattern` matches - `{number}` for `NumberPattern` matches  Example improvements: ```kotlin // Before assertThat(paths).containsExactly(""value"") assertThat(paths).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(""MultiAnyObject.data1"", ""MultiAnyObject.data2"")  // After assertThat(paths).containsExactly(""value{number}"") assertThat(paths).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(""{MultiAnyObject}.data1{string}"", ""{MultiAnyObject}.data2{number}"") ```  ## Benefits  - **Improved readability**: Schema names are clearly distinguished with braces - **Type clarity**: Scalar types are explicitly annotated based on actual matches - **Consistency**: All path assertions follow the same `{SchemaName}.field{scalarType}` pattern - **Cleaner test names**: Removed unnecessary example numbering  ## Testing  All changes maintain existing test functionality while improving assertion clarity.

3271587224,Refactor create_react_agent to use internal _AgentBuilder helper class,"This PR refactors the `create_react_agent` function to use an internal `_AgentBuilder` helper class, addressing maintainability and readability issues with the original implementation.  ## Problem  The `create_react_agent` function had grown to over 700 lines of complex, intertwined logic that was difficult to maintain, understand, and modify. The function handled multiple responsibilities including:  - Model and tool integration - State schema management  - Prompt handling - Node construction for LLM interaction - Structured output generation - Hook management (pre/post model) - Complex routing logic - Graph assembly  ## Solution  This refactoring introduces an internal `_AgentBuilder` class that encapsulates and organizes the agent construction logic into focused, manageable methods:  ### Core `_AgentBuilder` Methods  - `__init__`: Parameter validation and initialization - `_setup_model_and_tools()`: Model resolution and tool binding - `_create_model_node()`: Core LLM interaction node creation - `_create_structured_response_node()`: Structured output formatting - `_create_model_router()`: Execution flow routing after model calls - `_create_tools_router()`: Post-tool-call routing for return_direct behavior - `_setup_hooks()`: Pre/post model hook integration - `build()`: Final graph assembly and compilation  ### Key Benefits  1. **Improved Maintainability**: Logic is now organized into focused methods with clear responsibilities 2. **Enhanced Readability**: The `create_react_agent` function is now just 25 lines vs 700+ lines 3. **Better Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation 4. **No Breaking Changes**: The public API remains exactly the same 5. **No Unnecessary Abstractions**: The helper class is internal and focused solely on organization  ### Example  The refactored `create_react_agent` function now simply delegates to the builder:  ```python def create_react_agent(...) -> CompiledStateGraph:     """"""Creates an agent graph that calls tools in a loop until a stopping condition is met.""""""     builder = _AgentBuilder(         model=model,         tools=tools,         prompt=prompt,         response_format=response_format,         # ... all other parameters     )     return builder.build() ```  The `_AgentBuilder` class handles all the complex logic internally while maintaining the exact same functionality and behavior.

3169497988,Refactor SDK test dependencies from TestBase to TestProxyTestBase,"This PR completes the migration of SDK test classes from the legacy `TestBase` to `TestProxyTestBase` to enable test proxy functionality across the Azure SDK for Java.  ## Changes Made  Updated the following files to use `TestProxyTestBase` instead of directly depending on `TestBase`:  1. **`sdk/maps/azure-maps-search/src/test/java/com/azure/maps/search/TestUtils.java`**    - Changed import from `com.azure.core.test.TestBase` to `com.azure.core.test.TestProxyTestBase`    - Updated static method call from `TestBase.getHttpClients()` to `TestProxyTestBase.getHttpClients()`  2. **`sdk/eventhubs/azure-messaging-eventhubs/src/test/java/com/azure/messaging/eventhubs/IntegrationTestBase.java`**    - Changed import from `com.azure.core.test.TestBase` to `com.azure.core.test.TestProxyTestBase`    - Updated class declaration from `extends TestBase` to `extends TestProxyTestBase`  ## Analysis  - **Scope**: Only 2 files required migration from the core `TestBase` to `TestProxyTestBase` - **Existing state**: The majority of SDK test classes already correctly extend `TestProxyTestBase` - **Architecture preserved**: `TestBase` remains as the foundation class that `TestProxyTestBase` extends, following the established inheritance pattern:   ```   TestBase (foundation) ← TestProxyTestBase (adds test proxy) ← SDK Test Classes   ```  ## Architecture Decision  The original issue requested deleting `TestBase` entirely, but this would break the framework since `TestProxyTestBase` extends `TestBase`. The correct approach implemented here maintains the architectural integrity while ensuring all SDK test classes benefit from test proxy functionality.  Internal framework classes that import `TestBase` continue to use it appropriately for static utility methods and are unaffected by this change.

Assert.Equals(expected, actual); // Falls back to object.Equals() - no assertion! ```  ## Solution  Instead of removal, both methods are now marked with `[Obsolete]` attributes:  - **`Assert.Equals`**: Now obsolete instead of throwing `Assert.Fail()` - **`Assert.ReferenceEquals`**: New obsolete method to prevent similar issues  Both methods consistently return `false` and guide users to proper alternatives: - `Assert.Equals` → Use `Assert.AreEqual` and overloads - `Assert.ReferenceEquals` → Use `Assert.AreSame` and overloads  ## Implementation Details  - ✅ Modified `Assert.Equals` with `[Obsolete]` attribute - ✅ Added new `Assert.ReferenceEquals` with `[Obsolete]` attribute   - ✅ Added `DoNotUseAssertReferenceEquals` resource string with full localization (13 languages) - ✅ Updated `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` for new method - ✅ Added unit tests to verify obsolete behavior - ✅ Updated XML documentation  ## Testing  ```csharp #pragma warning disable CS0618 // Type or member is obsolete bool result1 = Assert.Equals(""test"", ""test"");        // Returns false, shows obsolete warning bool result2 = Assert.ReferenceEquals(obj, obj);     // Returns false, shows obsolete warning   #pragma warning restore CS0618 // Type or member is obsolete ```  This approach provides compile-time warnings while preventing the dangerous silent failure scenario.

3245438101,Refactor SpecmaticJUnitSupport to improve test isolation and object-oriented design,"## Overview  This PR refactors the `SpecmaticJUnitSupport` class and related components to improve test isolation and make the design more suitable for concurrent and parallel test execution by moving from static/singleton patterns to instance-based design.  ## Changes Made  ### 1. Moved Companion Object Properties to Instance Properties  The following properties have been moved from the companion object to become instance properties: - `partialSuccesses: MutableList` - `openApiCoverageReportInput: OpenApiCoverageReportInput` - `threads: Vector`  **Before:** ```kotlin companion object {     val partialSuccesses: MutableList = mutableListOf()     var openApiCoverageReportInput: OpenApiCoverageReportInput = OpenApiCoverageReportInput(...)     private val threads: Vector = Vector() } ```  **After:** ```kotlin class SpecmaticJUnitSupport {     internal val partialSuccesses: MutableList = mutableListOf()     internal var openApiCoverageReportInput: OpenApiCoverageReportInput = OpenApiCoverageReportInput(...)     internal val threads: Vector = Vector() } ```  ### 2. Converted Singleton Objects to Classes  #### TestReportHooks - Converted from `object TestReportHooks` to `class TestReportHooks` - Now instantiated as a property of `SpecmaticJUnitSupport` - Updated `onTestResult` method to accept `TestInteractionsLog` instance parameter  #### TestInteractionsLog   - Converted from `object TestInteractionsLog` to `class TestInteractionsLog` - Now instantiated as a property of `SpecmaticJUnitSupport` - Extension functions remain available for backward compatibility  ### 3. Updated HttpClient Integration  Modified `HttpClient` to accept a `TestInteractionsLog` instance parameter, enabling proper instance-based logging:  ```kotlin val httpClient = HttpClient(     testBaseURL,      log = log,      timeoutInMilliseconds = timeoutInMilliseconds,      testInteractionsLog = this.testInteractionsLog ) ```  ### 4. Backward Compatibility  Implemented a `currentInstance` pattern to maintain compatibility with existing static contexts:  ```kotlin companion object {     internal var currentInstance: SpecmaticJUnitSupport? = null          @AfterAll     @JvmStatic     fun report() {         currentInstance?.let { instance ->             // Use instance properties instead of static ones         }     } } ```  ### 5. Updated All References  - Updated all usages throughout the codebase to use instance-based access - Fixed extension function imports and scope issues - Updated test files to work with the new instance-based design - Maintained proper access to companion object constants (HOST, PORT, etc.)  ## Benefits  1. **Improved Test Isolation**: Each test instance now has its own state, preventing interference between tests 2. **Concurrent Execution Support**: Multiple test instances can run in parallel without shared state conflicts   3. **Better Object-Oriented Design**: Eliminates global mutable state in favor of instance-based design 4. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work through the `currentInstance` pattern  ## Testing  - ✅ All existing tests pass (94/94) - ✅ Compilation successful for both `junit5-support` and `specmatic-core` modules - ✅ No functional regressions detected - ✅ Extension functions and static contexts work correctly  ## Breaking Changes  This refactoring maintains backward compatibility for most use cases. The only potential breaking change is for code that directly accessed the moved properties from the companion object, but such usage should be rare in external code.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `https://api.github.com/repos/aquasecurity/trivy` >   - Triggering command: `REDACTED, pid is -1` (http block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config) > >     *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Refactor SpecmaticJUnitSupport and related components to improve test isolation and object-oriented design: >  > - Move the following properties from the companion object of SpecmaticJUnitSupport to become instance properties: `partialSuccesses`, `openApiCoverageReportInput`, and `threads`. > - Refactor TestReportHooks from an object into a class.

3110865366,refactor!: Rename `DefaultNodeHome` to `NodeHome`,"## Summary  Renames the exported constant `DefaultNodeHome` to `NodeHome` in the `app` package to better reflect its actual purpose and behavior.  ## Context  The constant `DefaultNodeHome` is misleading because it's not really a ""default"" value - it's the computed home directory path that takes into account both the default location and any `--home` flag specified by the user. The name `NodeHome` more accurately describes what this variable represents.  ## Changes  - **Breaking change**: Renamed `app.DefaultNodeHome` to `app.NodeHome` - Updated variable declaration and comment in `app/init.go` - Updated all 11 references across 9 files:   - `app/app.go`   - `cmd/celestia-appd/cmd/init.go`   - `cmd/celestia-appd/cmd/modify_root_command.go`   - `cmd/celestia-appd/cmd/root.go`   - `cmd/celestia-appd/cmd/modify_root_command_multiplexer.go`   - `cmd/celestia-appd/main.go`   - `test/cmd/txsim/cli.go`   - `test/cmd/txsim/cli_test.go` - Added test case in `app/app_test.go` to verify `NodeHome` accessibility  ## Testing  - All existing tests pass - Added new test `TestNodeHome` to verify the variable is properly set and accessible - Verified no functionality is broken by the rename  ## Breaking Change Notice  This is a breaking change for external consumers that reference `app.DefaultNodeHome`.

3267844578,Rename CompletePublishAsync to CompleteAsync in IPublishingActivityReporter,"This PR renames the `CompletePublishAsync` method to `CompleteAsync` on the `IPublishingActivityReporter` interface and its implementation to improve API consistency and naming clarity.  ## Background  The `IPublishingActivityReporter` interface had a method named `CompletePublishAsync` that signals when the entire publishing process has completed. However, this naming was inconsistent with other completion methods in the codebase, such as `IPublishingStep.CompleteAsync` and `PublishingTask.CompleteAsync`, which use the simpler `CompleteAsync` naming pattern.  ## Changes  - **Interface**: Renamed `CompletePublishAsync` to `CompleteAsync` in `IPublishingActivityReporter` - **Implementation**: Updated method implementation in `PublishingActivityReporter` class - **Call Sites**: Updated 2 method calls in `DistributedApplicationRunner.cs` - **Tests**: Updated 5 test method names and 10 method calls in `PublishingActivityReporterTests.cs`  ## Verification  - ✅ No naming conflicts with existing `CompleteAsync` methods (they exist on different types) - ✅ All builds compile successfully without errors or warnings - ✅ XML documentation preserved and correctly generated - ✅ No remaining references to the old method name in source code  The method signature and behavior remain unchanged - this is purely a naming improvement for consistency across the publishing API.    *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Rename the method CompletePublishAsync to CompleteAsync on the IPublishingActivityReporter and its implementation(s). Update all call sites, documentation comments, and tests accordingly to use the new method name.

3204689046,Refactor MultiEditorTabsControl to remove instance checks and improve generic design,"## Problem  The `MultiEditorTabsControl` contained instance checks (`instanceof`) against specific filtered editor group model implementations (`UnstickyEditorGroupModel` and `StickyEditorGroupModel`), creating unwanted coupling between the generic tabs control and specific model implementations.  ```typescript // Before: Problematic instance checks let targetEditorIndex = this.tabsModel instanceof UnstickyEditorGroupModel      ? targetTabIndex + this.groupView.stickyCount      : targetTabIndex;  const options: IEditorOptions = {     sticky: this.tabsModel instanceof StickyEditorGroupModel &&              this.tabsModel.stickyCount === targetEditorIndex,     index: targetEditorIndex }; ```  This violated the principle of programming to interfaces and made the supposedly generic control dependent on concrete implementations.  ## Solution  Replaced instance checks with property-based logic using the `stickyCount` property available on the `IReadonlyEditorGroupModel` interface:  ```typescript // After: Generic property-based approach let targetEditorIndex = this.tabsModel.stickyCount === 0      ? targetTabIndex + this.groupView.stickyCount      : targetTabIndex;  const options: IEditorOptions = {     sticky: this.tabsModel.stickyCount > 0 &&              this.tabsModel.stickyCount === targetEditorIndex,     index: targetEditorIndex }; ```  ## Key Changes  - **Removed instance checks**: No more `instanceof` against `StickyEditorGroupModel` or `UnstickyEditorGroupModel` - **Property-based detection**: Uses `stickyCount` to determine model behavior:   - `stickyCount === 0` indicates `UnstickyEditorGroupModel`    - `stickyCount > 0` indicates `StickyEditorGroupModel` - **Cleaner imports**: Removed unnecessary imports of specific filtered model classes - **Preserved functionality**: Logic remains identical, maintaining exact same behavior  ## Benefits  - ✅ **Better architecture**: Generic control no longer coupled to specific implementations - ✅ **Interface compliance**: Only depends on `IReadonlyEditorGroupModel` interface - ✅ **Maintainability**: Future model implementations work without code changes - ✅ **Zero regression**: Comprehensive testing confirms identical behavior  This change makes the multi-editor tabs control truly generic and follows proper object-oriented design principles.   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3210325463,Refactor event restarter to use proper debounce pattern,"## Problem  The `register_event_restarter` function was using simple time-based filtering that would ignore events arriving too soon after a restart was already sent. This was **not** true debouncing behavior and could miss legitimate restart requests during rapid configuration changes.  ## Solution  Implemented proper debounce logic that: - **Cancels existing timers** when new events arrive - **Resets the delay** for each new event   - **Only triggers restart** after the full delay passes without any new events  ## Key Changes  ### Before (Time-based filtering) ```rust let mut last_send = Instant::now(); loop {     let cause = restart_receiver.recv().await.unwrap_or_default();     let now = Instant::now();     if now.duration_since(last_send) < Duration::from_millis(delay) {         debug!(""Ignoring restart request ({cause}) too soon after last send"");         continue; // Event discarded!     }     // Send restart immediately     event_sender.send(TransferType::Restart).await.warn(""unable to send restart"");     last_send = now; } ```  ### After (True debounce) ```rust let debounce_timer = Rc::new(RefCell::new(None::)); loop {     let cause = restart_receiver.recv().await.unwrap_or_default();          // Cancel any existing timer     if let Some(timer_id) = debounce_timer.borrow_mut().take() {         timer_id.remove();     }          // Create new timer that will trigger restart after delay     let timer_id = glib::timeout_add_local_once(Duration::from_millis(delay), move || {         // Send restart only after timer completes         event_sender.send(TransferType::Restart).await.warn(""unable to send restart"");     });          *debounce_timer.borrow_mut() = Some(timer_id); } ```  ## Behavior Examples  ### Scenario 1: Single event - Event arrives → Timer starts (1500ms) - Timer completes → Restart triggered - **Result**: 1 restart after 1500ms  ### Scenario 2: Rapid successive events   - Event 1 arrives → Timer 1 starts (1500ms) - Event 2 arrives (500ms later) → Timer 1 cancelled, Timer 2 starts (1500ms) - Event 3 arrives (300ms later) → Timer 2 cancelled, Timer 3 starts (1500ms) - Timer 3 completes → Restart triggered - **Result**: 1 restart after all events quiet for 1500ms  ### Scenario 3: Events with sufficient gaps - Event 1 arrives → Timer 1 starts (1500ms) - Timer 1 completes → Restart 1 triggered - Event 2 arrives (2000ms later) → Timer 2 starts (1500ms)   - Timer 2 completes → Restart 2 triggered - **Result**: 2 restarts, each after their respective delays  ## Technical Implementation  - Uses `glib::SourceId` for timer management (compatible with existing async infrastructure) - `Rc>>` for shared timer state - `timer_id.remove()` for timer cancellation - `glib::timeout_add_local_once()` for creating timers - Maintains all existing async patterns and error handling  ## Benefits  - **Proper debouncing**: Rapid successive events collapse into a single restart - **No missed events**: Events are never discarded, only delayed - **Better UX**: Reduces unnecessary restarts during rapid configuration changes - **Resource efficiency**: Prevents resource thrashing from multiple quick restarts - **Backward compatible**: Still respects `HYPRSHELL_RELOAD_TIMEOUT` environment variable  Fixes the reload debouncing issue mentioned in the changelog.  *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Refactor the `register_event_restarter` function in `src/start.rs` to implement a debounced event handling logic as follows: >  > - When an event is received, instead of discarding it if it arrives sooner than a specified delay, start a debounce timer (with the delay duration, default 1500ms or as per HYPRSHELL_RELOAD_TIMEOUT). > - If another event is received before the timer expires, reset the timer and wait for the full delay again. > - Only after a full delay period passes **without any new event** should the function trigger a `TransferType::Restart` via the event sender. > - This ensures that rapid successive events collapse into a single restart trigger, only after event activity has quieted for the given delay. >  > The end result should match the debounce pattern described in the prompt, using async mechanisms appropriate for the rest of the codebase.   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3210327689,Refactor asset conversion/management: Move to CLI tool and enable direct WAD loading,"This PR implements a comprehensive refactoring of OpenKeeper's asset conversion and management system to address the requirements outlined in #486.  ## 🎯 Key Changes  ### 1. Standalone Asset Converter CLI - **New `AssetConverterCLI.java`**: Replaces GUI-based conversion integrated into game startup - **Command-line interface** with options for custom DK II folder, force overwrite, and skipping models - **Gradle integration**: Added `assetConverterCLI` task for easy execution - **Cross-platform friendly**: Enables Android builds without requiring runtime conversion  ```bash # Convert all assets ./gradlew assetConverterCLI  # Skip model conversion and load directly from WAD ./gradlew assetConverterCLI -PcliArgs=""--skip-models"" ```  ### 2. Direct WAD File Loading - **New `WadAssetLocator.java`**: Loads assets directly from original DK II files - **Priority system**: Extracted assets take precedence over WAD files for modding - **Support for multiple formats**:   - KMF models from `Meshes.WAD`   - Textures from `EngineTextures.dat`   - Sounds from `Sounds.WAD`  ### 3. Removed .j3o Model Generation - **Modified `ConvertModels.java`**: Extracts raw KMF files instead of converting to .j3o - **Runtime loading**: Models converted from KMF to JME objects at runtime using existing `KmfModelLoader` - **Better editability**: Raw KMF files can be viewed/modified by external tools - **Reduced storage**: Eliminates duplicate data in both KMF and .j3o formats  ### 4. Game Startup Optimization - **Modified `Main.java`**: Removed asset conversion dependency from startup - **Faster launches**: Game starts immediately without conversion delays - **Dual asset loading**: Registers both `FileLocator` (extracted) and `WadAssetLocator` (original)  ## 🚀 Benefits  ### For Users - **Instant startup**: No more waiting for asset conversion when launching the game - **Smaller disk usage**: Can skip model conversion entirely - **Better modding support**: Easy to replace individual assets while keeping others original  ### For Developers - **Cross-platform builds**: Especially important for Android deployment (#218) - **Cleaner architecture**: Asset conversion separated from game logic - **Easier testing**: Can test game without full asset conversion  ## 📋 Asset Loading Priority  1. **Extracted/converted assets** (highest priority) - Located in assets folder 2. **Original WAD files** (fallback) - Loaded directly from DK II installation   3. **Built-in defaults** (lowest priority) - Embedded in JAR  ## 🔄 Migration  **Existing users**: No action required. The game automatically uses the new priority system.  **Fresh installs**:  1. Set DK II folder in game settings 2. Optionally run `./gradlew assetConverterCLI` for faster loading  ## 📚 Documentation  Added comprehensive `ASSET_CONVERSION_REFACTOR.md` with: - Usage examples and command-line options - Migration guide for existing users - Technical implementation details - Troubleshooting information  ## ✅ Testing  - CLI argument parsing validated with automated tests - Backward compatibility maintained for existing converted assets - Asset loading priority system verified  This refactoring achieves all the goals outlined in the issue: moves conversion out of startup, enables direct WAD loading, removes .j3o generation, and maintains excellent modding support.

3211507551,Remove redundant `bootstrappedAt` field from ScaleRecord,"This PR removes the redundant `bootstrappedAt` field from `ScaleRecord` and replaces its usage with `scalingPosition`. Both fields served the same purpose - tracking the position when scaling started - making one of them unnecessary.  ## Changes Made  ### Core Changes - **Removed `bootstrappedAt` field** from `ScaleRecord.java` - **Removed `getBootstrappedAt()` and `setBootstrappedAt()` methods** from `ScaleRecord.java` - **Removed `getBootstrappedAt()` method** from `ScaleRecordValue.java` interface - **Updated constructor** to reduce property count from 6 to 5 and remove `bootstrappedAt` property declaration - **Updated `statusResponse()` method** to use `scalingPosition` parameter instead of `bootstrappedAt`  ### Usage Updates - **Updated `SnapshotApiRequestHandler`** to use `getScalingPosition()` instead of `getBootstrappedAt()` - **Updated test files** to remove references to the removed field and use `getScalingPosition()` instead  ### Files Modified - `zeebe/protocol-impl/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/protocol/impl/record/value/scaling/ScaleRecord.java` - `zeebe/protocol/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/protocol/record/value/scaling/ScaleRecordValue.java` - `zeebe/broker/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/broker/transport/snapshotapi/SnapshotApiRequestHandler.java` - `zeebe/protocol-impl/src/test/java/io/camunda/zeebe/protocol/impl/JsonSerializableToJsonTest.java` - `zeebe/engine/src/test/java/io/camunda/zeebe/engine/scaling/ScaleUpTest.java`  ## Validation  ✅ Protocol module compiled successfully, confirming interface changes are correct   ✅ Generated immutable classes no longer contain `bootstrappedAt` field   ✅ All references to the removed field have been updated to use `scalingPosition`   ✅ Routing state methods preserved as they manage the storage mechanism for scaling positions    ## Note  The routing state methods like `bootstrappedAt()` are intentionally kept as they serve as the storage mechanism for scaling position data and are part of the internal state management. Only the redundant ScaleRecord field was removed.  Since this field was added in 8.8.0-alpha, there are no compatibility concerns with removing it.

3254883514,Refactor DescriptionTestDataFactory to use deterministic values instead of random generation,"## Overview  This PR refactors the `DescriptionTestDataFactory` class to eliminate random number generation and replace it with deterministic, non-default values for creating test Description objects. This change improves test reliability and predictability by removing the dependency on random number generation.  ## Changes Made  ### Method Renaming All factory methods have been renamed to better reflect their new behavior: - `createRandomCellDescription` → `createNonDefaultCellDescription` - `createRandomParticleDescription` → `createNonDefaultParticleDescription`   - `createRandomNodeDescription` → `createNonDefaultNodeDescription` - `createRandomCreatureDescription` → `createNonDefaultCreatureDescription` - `createRandomCellTypeDescription` → `createNonDefaultCellTypeDescription` (private) - `createRandomCellTypeGenomeDescription` → `createNonDefaultCellTypeGenomeDescription` (private)  ### Random Generation Removal - Removed `getRandomFloat`, `getRandomFloat2`, and `getRandomInt` helper methods - Replaced all `getRandomFloat()` calls with fixed float values (e.g., `0.5f`, `0.7f`, `0.3f`) - Replaced all `getRandomFloat2()` calls with fixed `RealVector2D` coordinates (e.g., `{0.5f, 0.8f}`) - Replaced all `getRandomInt()` calls with fixed integer values that differ from defaults - Removed `#include ""EngineInterface/NumberGenerator.h""` dependency  ### Deterministic Values Used The new implementation uses carefully chosen non-default values: - **Positions/Velocities**: Fixed coordinates like `{0.5f, 0.8f}` instead of `{0.0f, 0.0f}` defaults - **Energy**: `150.0f` for cells (default: `100.0f`), `75.0f` for particles (default: `0.0f`) - **Colors**: Fixed values like `3`, `4`, `5` instead of default `0` - **Ages/Counters**: Non-zero values like `42`, `15`, `8` instead of default `0` - **Angles**: Fixed angles like `45.0f`, `90.0f`, `180.0f` instead of default `0.0f` - **Boolean flags**: Appropriate non-default values where applicable  ### Test Files Updated Updated all references to the renamed methods in: - `source/EngineTests/DataTransferTests.cpp` - `source/EngineTests/ConstructorTests.cpp` - `source/PersisterTests/SerializerServiceTest.cpp`  ## Benefits  1. **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now produce consistent, predictable results across runs 2. **Better Debugging**: Fixed values make it easier to debug test failures 3. **Clearer Intent**: Method names now accurately reflect that they create objects with non-default (but deterministic) values 4. **Reduced Dependencies**: No longer depends on `NumberGenerator` for test data creation 5. **Maintained Test Coverage**: All existing test scenarios continue to work with the same comprehensive coverage  ## Verification  - All method signatures remain compatible with existing usage patterns - The changes maintain the same test coverage for all cell types, node types, and muscle modes - Compilation verified with syntax validation - No breaking changes to the public API beyond the method renames  This refactoring ensures that the test data factory continues to create meaningful test objects with non-default values while providing the reliability and predictability expected from a robust test suite.  *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Update DescriptionTestDataFactory to remove random number generation when creating Description objects. Specifically, replace all usages of getRandomFloat, getRandomFloat2, and getRandomInt used in creating a Description object by assigning values that are not the default for the corresponding members in the Description class.

3266828491,Change default value of GeneDescription separation from true to false,"This PR implements the requested change to modify the default value of the `separation` member in `GeneDescription` from `true` to `false`, ensuring all existing tests continue to pass by explicitly setting separation values where needed.  ## Changes Made  ### Core Change - **`source/EngineInterface/GenomeDescription.h`**: Changed the default value of the `separation` field from `true` to `false`:   ```cpp   MEMBER(GeneDescription, bool, separation, false);  // Changed from true   ```  ### Test Updates Updated all test files to explicitly set `separation(true)` for tests that relied on the previous default behavior:  - **`source/EngineTests/ConstructorTests.cpp`**: Updated 15+ test cases including `emptyGene`, `nodeIndexOutOfRange`, `geneIndexOutOfRange`, and various constructor test scenarios - **`source/EngineTests/GenomeDescriptionEditServiceTests.cpp`**: Updated test patterns in gene manipulation tests - **`source/EngineTests/GenomeDescriptionInfoServiceTests.cpp`**: Updated 20+ test patterns for genome analysis functions - **`source/EngineTests/DataTransferTests.cpp`**: Updated GeneDescription patterns in data transfer tests - **`source/EngineTests/EnergyFlowTests.cpp`**: Updated patterns that used `numBranches` with appropriate separation settings  ### GUI Updates - **`source/Gui/GenomeEditorWidget.cpp`**: Updated gene creation in the genome editor to explicitly set `separation(true)` to maintain existing UI behavior  ## Rationale  The separation flag controls whether nodes in a gene are constructed as separate branches (`separation=true`) or combined according to the `numBranches` setting (`separation=false`). By changing the default to `false`, new genes will use the more compact branching behavior by default, while existing code that expects separation behavior now explicitly sets `separation(true)`.  ## Verification  - All existing tests that depended on the old default now explicitly set `separation(true)` - Tests that already used `separation(false)` remain unchanged - No implicit dependencies on the old default value remain in the codebase - The change affects 7 files with a net change of +84/-83 lines, maintaining the same functionality while making the new default explicit  This change ensures that all tests in `ConstructorTests.cpp` and other test suites will continue to pass while adopting the new default behavior for future gene descriptions.  > [!WARNING] > >  > Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses > > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules: > > - `esm.ubuntu.com` >   - Triggering command: `/usr/lib/apt/methods/https` (dns block) > > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either: > > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to the custom allowlist in this repository's [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/chrxh/alien/settings/copilot/coding_agent) (admins only) > >    *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Change the default value of the separateConstruction member in GenomeHeaderDescription (source/EngineInterface/GenomeDescriptions.h) from true to false. Ensure that all code and tests—especially those in source/EngineTests/ConstructorTests.cpp—are updated so that tests relying on the old default now explicitly set separateConstruction=true as needed.

Thank you!  ## Summary  Refactored all sensor interfaces (`ICompass`, `IGyroscope`, `IAccelerometer`, `IMagnetometer`, `IBarometer`) to implement `ISensor` and `IDeviceCapabilities` explicitly rather than through inheritance. This preserves backward compatibility for libraries built with net8/net9 while enabling explicit interface usage for the new hierarchy pattern.  ## Changes Made  ### Before ```csharp public interface ICompass : ISensor {     void Start(SensorSpeed sensorSpeed, bool applyLowPassFilter);     event EventHandler ReadingChanged; } ```  ### After ```csharp public interface ICompass {     // Public members for backward compatibility     bool IsSupported { get; }     bool IsMonitoring { get; }     void Start(SensorSpeed sensorSpeed);     void Start(SensorSpeed sensorSpeed, bool applyLowPassFilter);     void Stop();     event EventHandler ReadingChanged; }  partial class CompassImplementation : ICompass, ISensor, IDeviceCapabilities {     // Explicit interface implementations that delegate to public members     bool ISensor.IsMonitoring => IsMonitoring;     void ISensor.Start(SensorSpeed sensorSpeed) => Start(sensorSpeed);     void ISensor.Stop() => Stop();     bool IDeviceCapabilities.IsSupported => IsSupported; } ```  ## Benefits  1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing public members (`IsSupported`, `IsMonitoring`, `Start`, `Stop`) remain as public members of each interface 2. **Explicit Interface Support**: New code can use explicit interface casting for the `ISensor`/`IDeviceCapabilities` hierarchy 3. **Delegation Pattern**: Explicit interface implementations delegate to the public members, ensuring consistent behavior  ## Testing  - ✅ All existing unit tests pass (293/293) - ensuring backward compatibility - ✅ Added comprehensive tests for explicit interface functionality - ✅ Verified all sensor implementations can be cast to `ISensor` and `IDeviceCapabilities` - ✅ Confirmed delegation works correctly between explicit and public interface members  ## Example Usage  ```csharp // Backward compatibility - existing code continues to work var compass = Compass.Default; bool isMonitoring = compass.IsMonitoring; compass.Start(SensorSpeed.Default);  // New explicit interface usage ISensor sensor = compass; IDeviceCapabilities deviceCap = compass; bool isMonitoringViaSensor = sensor.IsMonitoring; // Delegates to public member ```  This change maintains full backward compatibility while enabling the new interface hierarchy pattern for future development.  *This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.* > Refactor all sensor interfaces (ICompass, IGyroscope, IAccelerometer, etc.) so that: > - All existing public members (e.g., IsSupported, IsMonitoring, Start, Stop) remain as public members of the interface. > - The new ISensor and IDeviceCap interfaces are implemented explicitly, delegating their members to the public ones as shown in the compatibility comment pattern. > - This preserves backward compatibility for libraries built with net8/net9 and allows explicit interface usage for the new hierarchy.   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Consider using brokered authentication instead"" - Updated API surface files for both .NET 8.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 to reflect the deprecation - Added `#pragma warning disable CS0618` suppressions in:   - Test methods that verify the property functionality    - Internal implementation code in `MsalPublicClient.cs` that still needs to support the property for backward compatibility  ## Background  The embedded browser functionality depends on Windows Forms, which requires the Microsoft.Identity.Client.Desktop assembly. Azure.Identity does not support the `WithWindowsEmbeddedBrowserSupport` scenario offered by MSAL directly, so users would need to use MSAL directly to utilize this feature. To address this limitation, we are deprecating this property and recommending users consider brokered authentication instead.  ## Backward Compatibility  The property remains functional for existing code but will now emit compiler warnings encouraging migration to alternative authentication methods. All existing tests continue to pass with appropriate warning suppressions.  Fixes #50495.","The PR deprecates a property by adding the Obsolete attribute and related warning suppressions, which is a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a new feature.

Please use language version 7.0 or later, or download .NET 9 SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet which was the last version to support F# 4.7. ```  ### Phase 2: Complete F# 4.7 Feature Removal Removed all feature toggles and made the following F# 4.7 features always enabled:  #### 🔹 **WildCardInForLoop** - Always allow wildcard patterns in for loops ```fsharp // Now always works without version checks for _ in 1..10 do printfn ""hello"" ```  #### 🔹 **RelaxWhitespace** - Always enable relaxed whitespace rules   ```fsharp // Relaxed indentation rules now always apply type MyType() =     static member Method() = 42 ```  #### 🔹 **ImplicitYield** - Always use modern yield-free logic ```fsharp // Modern computation expression behavior now always enabled seq { 1; 2; 3 } // No explicit 'yield' required ```  #### 🔹 **SingleUnderscorePattern** - Always allow `_.` syntax ```fsharp // Underscore dot patterns now always supported match obj with | _.Property -> // Always works ```  ## Technical Changes  ### Conditional Logic Removal - **ParseHelpers.fs**: Removed feature check for wildcard patterns in for loops - **LexFilter.fs**: Removed feature check for relaxed whitespace rules   - **CheckExpressionsOps.fs**: Always use modern yield-free logic - **pars.fsy**: Removed parser feature checks for underscore patterns  ### Feature Definition Cleanup - Removed `SingleUnderscorePattern`, `WildCardInForLoop`, `RelaxWhitespace`, `ImplicitYield` from `LanguageFeature` enum - Removed F# 4.7 entries from features dictionary mapping - Removed F# 4.7 entries from `GetFeatureString` method - Updated expression type checkers to always enable modern behavior  ### Build & Compatibility - ✅ All changes compile successfully - ✅ F# 4.7 features now always enabled as core language features - ✅ Maintains backward compatibility - existing code continues to work - ✅ Provides clear migration path for users on older SDKs  ## Impact  This change **simplifies the compiler codebase** by removing conditional feature checks while **maintaining full backward compatibility**. All F# 4.7 language features are now always available, eliminating the need for version-specific behavior branches.  Users get **clearer error messages** when attempting to use unsupported versions, with **actionable guidance** on upgrading to supported versions or using .NET 9 SDK for legacy support.  ## Next Steps  Future phases will apply the same methodology to remove F# 5.0 and 6.0 feature toggles, then update language version constants and clean up remaining references.

3200632529,Rename IPublishingActivityProgressReporter to IPublishingActivityReporter,"## Summary  This PR renames the `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` interface and its implementing classes to use the shorter, more concise name `IPublishingActivityReporter`. The change affects:  - `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` → `IPublishingActivityReporter` - `PublishingActivityProgressReporter` → `PublishingActivityReporter` - `NullPublishingActivityProgressReporter` → `NullPublishingActivityReporter`  ## Changes Made  - **Interface Renaming**: Updated the main interface from `IPublishingActivityProgressReporter` to `IPublishingActivityReporter` - **Implementation Classes**: Renamed both the concrete implementation and null object pattern implementation - **File Renames**: Updated corresponding file names to match the new class names - **References**: Updated all references throughout the codebase including:   - Service registrations in `DistributedApplicationBuilder`   - Usage in publishing contexts (`PublishingContext`, `DeployingContext`, etc.)   - Test files and test class names   - API definitions in generated files   - Compatibility suppression entries  ## Testing  - ✅ All 28 `PublishingActivityReporterTests` pass - ✅ All 12 `PublishingTests` pass   - ✅ 35/36 tests in Publishing namespace pass (1 unrelated infrastructure failure) - ✅ Build succeeds without warnings - ✅ JSON serialization of `PublishingActivity` works correctly with existing discriminator pattern  ## Design Notes  The `PublishingActivity` class continues to use its existing string-based discriminator pattern (`Type` field) to distinguish between Step, Task, PublishComplete, and Prompt activities. This discriminated union approach is appropriate for the sealed class design and works correctly with JSON serialization.  ## Breaking Changes  ⚠️ **This is a breaking change** for any external code that references these types. However, since these APIs are marked with `[Experimental(""ASPIREPUBLISHERS001"")]`, breaking changes are expected and acceptable.   ---  💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

3226056235,Complete catalog refactor cleanup: Remove unnecessary using statements and ensure consistent formatting,"Completes the catalog refactor implementation by cleaning up unnecessary using statements and ensuring consistent formatting across all catalog files in the remaining directories.  ## Changes Made  ### Cleaned up unnecessary using statements from 18 catalog files:  **e-k/ directory (14 files):** - ElderRay, Epma, Fcb, FisherTransform, ForceIndex, Gator, HeikinAshi, Hma, HtTrendline, Hurst, Ichimoku, Kama, Keltner, Kvo  **m-r/ directory (4 files):**   - Mama, Marubozu, Mfi, Obv  ### Removed statements: ```csharp using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using Skender.Stock.Indicators; ```  These were unnecessary because: - The files are already in the `Skender.Stock.Indicators` namespace - `System` and `System.Collections.Generic` are not used in catalog files - Global using statements in `GlobalUsings.cs` provide required imports  ### Consistent formatting achieved: All catalog files now follow the same clean pattern: ```csharp namespace Skender.Stock.Indicators;  public static partial class IndicatorName {     // Catalog definitions... } ```  ## Validation  - ✅ All 873 tests still pass (871 succeeded, 2 skipped, 0 failed) - ✅ Build successful with no warnings - ✅ Consistent formatting across all catalog implementations - ✅ No functional changes to catalog behavior  ## Context  This completes the catalog refactor work mentioned in the original issue. The a-d/ directory was already cleaned up in previous work. The s-z/ directory has no catalog files (by design), so the cleanup focused on the remaining e-k/ and m-r/ directories.  The core catalog system remains functionally complete and working correctly - this change only improves code cleanliness and consistency.   ---  💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

3142850147,Refactor dragAndDropThought: replace mouseUp with hold parameter and add dragAndHoldThought helper,"The `mouseUp` parameter in the `dragAndDropThought` puppeteer helper was confusing because it defaulted to falsey but most use cases expected the drag to complete (mouse up). This PR splits the functionality into two clear helpers and improves the API design.  ## Changes  ### 1. Replace `mouseUp` with `hold` parameter - Changed `mouseUp?: boolean` to `hold?: boolean` in `dragAndDropThought` - Inverted the logic: now defaults to completing the drop (`mouse.up()`) unless `hold: true` - Updated parameter documentation for clarity  ### 2. Add new `dragAndHoldThought` helper - New function that calls `dragAndDropThought` with `hold: true` - Makes the intent explicit when you want to hold the drag without completing it - Same signature as `dragAndDropThought` but without the `hold` parameter  ### 3. Update existing usage - Removed `mouseUp: true` from test calls (now default behavior) - Changed `mouseUp: false` to use `dragAndHoldThought()` for clarity - Updated imports to include the new helper  ## Before/After API  **Before:** ```typescript // Confusing - mouseUp: true was needed for the common case await dragAndDropThought('a', 'b', { position: 'after', mouseUp: true })  // mouseUp: false to hold the drag await dragAndDropThought('a', null, { position: 'none', mouseUp: false }) ```  **After:** ```typescript // Clear - completes the drop by default await dragAndDropThought('a', 'b', { position: 'after' })  // Explicit intent to hold the drag await dragAndHoldThought('a', null, { position: 'none' }) ```  The new API follows the principle of making the common case (completing the drop) the default, while providing a clear alternative for holding the drag.

3158968364,Refactor workflow utils to arrays,"### **User description** This pull request refactors the workflow utilities in the Giselle AI codebase from using Map-based data structures to array-based data structures, significantly simplifying the API and implementation.    ## Key Changes    ### API Simplification  The most significant change is to the `buildWorkflowFromNode` function signature [1](#0-0) . Previously, it required three separate parameters (node ID, nodes array, connections array), but now it takes just two: the actual node object and a workspace-like graph object containing both nodes and connections.    ### Removed Map-Based Workflow Building  The PR removes the entire `buildWorkflowMap` function and its associated test file . This function previously created workflows from Map data structures, but the new approach focuses on building workflows from individual starting nodes using arrays.    ### New Graph Slicing Logic  A new `sliceGraphFromNode` function was added [2](#0-1)  that extracts only the connected subgraph starting from a given node. This replaces the complex Map-based connection traversal logic.    ### Simplified Helper Functions  The helper functions were significantly streamlined. The old `createConnectedNodeIdMap`, `findConnectedNodeMap`, and `createJobMap` functions were replaced with a single `buildJobList` function [3](#0-2)  that works directly with arrays.    ## Impact on Calling Code    ### UI Components  Multiple UI components were updated to use the new API. For example, in the run button components, the calls changed from:  ```typescript  buildWorkflowFromNode(startingNode.id, data.nodes, data.connections)  ```  to:  ```typescript  buildWorkflowFromNode(startingNode, data)  ```      ### Engine Integration  The engine's flow runner was updated to first find the trigger node before building the workflow [4](#0-3) , making the API more type-safe by requiring the actual node object rather than just its ID.    ### Removed Workspace Creation Logic  The sample workspace creation logic was simplified by removing the workflow map building step [5](#0-4) , indicating that this functionality may no longer be needed or was moved elsewhere.    ## Benefits    This refactor achieves several improvements:  - **Simpler API**: Fewer parameters and more intuitive function signatures  - **Better type safety**: Passing node objects instead of IDs prevents runtime errors  - **Reduced complexity**: 683 fewer lines of code (-910 +227)  - **Cleaner separation**: Graph slicing is now a separate, focused function    The changes maintain the same core functionality while making the codebase more maintainable and easier to use.    ## Notes    The PR removes the `buildWorkflowMap` export from the package index [6](#0-5) , indicating this was likely an internal refactoring that doesn't break the public API. The test updates show that the new array-based approach maintains the same workflow building behavior while being more straightforward to test and understand.

3156085708,Refactor flow controller hook,"### **User description** This pull request refactors the `use-flow-controller` hook in the workflow designer UI to improve code organization and maintainability by breaking down complex flow execution logic into smaller, focused helper functions.    ## Summary    The PR modifies the flow controller hook that manages workflow execution in Giselle's visual workflow designer. The main changes involve extracting inline logic into dedicated helper functions and adding proper TypeScript type exports.    ## Key Changes    ### 1. Flow Controller Refactoring    The main refactoring occurs in `internal-packages/workflow-designer-ui/src/hooks/use-flow-controller.tsx`, where the previously monolithic `startFlow` function has been broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces:    **New Helper Functions:**  - `patchRunAnnotations` - Handles adding error annotations to flow runs [1](#0-0)   - `runOperation` - Manages individual operation execution within jobs [2](#0-1)     The refactored code extracts complex nested logic that was previously embedded within the main flow execution loop. This improves readability and makes the code easier to test and maintain.    ### 2. Type Export Additions    Two files were modified to properly export the `FlowRunId` type:    **Flow Module Export:** [3](#0-2)     **Core Engine Export:** [4](#0-3)     These exports make the `FlowRunId` type available for use in the refactored flow controller hook, ensuring proper TypeScript typing throughout the system.    ## Impact on Codebase    ### Improved Maintainability  The refactoring makes the flow execution logic more modular by separating concerns:  - Error handling is now centralized in `patchRunAnnotations`  - Operation execution logic is isolated in `runOperation`  - The main flow logic becomes cleaner and easier to follow    ### Better Type Safety  By properly exporting `FlowRunId` from the giselle-engine package, the workflow designer UI can now use strongly-typed identifiers for flow runs, reducing potential runtime errors.    ### Testing Benefits  The extracted helper functions can be tested independently, making it easier to write comprehensive unit tests for different aspects of flow execution.    ## Notes    This is a pure refactoring PR that doesn't change the functional behavior of the workflow execution system. The changes focus on code organization and maintainability while preserving the existing API and functionality. The PR includes proper testing instructions using Turbo's type checking and test commands to ensure no regressions were introduced.

3092766038,refactor: consolidate ID generator to Zod v4 and remove legacy v3 implementation,"## Summary  This PR consolidates the ID generation utilities by removing the obsolete Zod v3 implementation and promoting the Zod v4 version as the default. This simplifies the API and eliminates legacy code dependencies.  ## Changes Made  ### Utils Package - **Removed**: `createIdGenerator` function that used Zod v3 - **Renamed**: `createIdGeneratorV4` → `createIdGenerator` (now the default) - **Updated**: Function documentation to reflect Zod v4 usage - **Removed**: Zod v3 import dependency  ### Data-Type Package   - **Updated**: Import statements across 11 files to use the simplified `createIdGenerator` import - **Affected modules**: connection, flow triggers, generation, nodes, runs, workflows, workspace, and GitHub integrations  ## Benefits  - **Simplified API**: Single `createIdGenerator` function instead of two variants - **Reduced complexity**: Eliminates the need for import aliasing (`createIdGeneratorV4 as createIdGenerator`) - **Cleaner codebase**: Removes legacy Zod v3 dependencies and dead code - **Future-ready**: All ID generation now consistently uses Zod v4  ## Testing  Verified with the following commands: - `turbo build --filter ""@giselle-sdk/utils"" --filter ""@giselle-sdk/data-type"" --cache=local:rw` - `turbo check-types --filter ""@giselle-sdk/utils"" --filter ""@giselle-sdk/data-type"" --cache=local:rw`   - `turbo test --filter ""@giselle-sdk/utils"" --filter ""@giselle-sdk/data-type"" --cache=local:rw`  ## Impact  This is a **breaking change** for any external consumers of `createIdGeneratorV4`, but since this appears to be internal tooling, the impact should be minimal. All existing functionality remains the same, just with a cleaner API.    ## Summary by CodeRabbit  - **Refactor**   - Streamlined and unified the ID generator to use an updated validation library, simplifying its usage and removing legacy support. - **Chores**   - Updated internal references to the ID generator to use the new, consolidated implementation.",title provides conventional commit label,Readability Refactoring (Renaming / Naming Consistency),OpenAI_Codex,external quality attribute

3158795501,Refactor runFlow execution,"### **User description** I cannot provide a complete explanation of this pull request because the actual modified file `packages/giselle-engine/src/core/flows/run-flow.ts` is not included in the codebase context provided to me.     Based on the PR description, this refactoring appears to focus on improving the readability of the `runFlow` function by:    ## Summary of Changes    The PR refactors `packages/giselle-engine/src/core/flows/run-flow.ts` to:  - Simplify the main `runFlow` function by extracting helper functions  - Add new utility functions: `runJob` and `executeOperation`  - Define a `Callbacks` type for better type safety  - Add a `createQueuedGeneration` helper function    ## Context from Available Code    From the codebase context, I can see that Giselle has a workflow execution system with related functionality:    - The `GiselleEngine` provides workflow execution through `runApi`, `addRun`, and `startRun` methods [1](#0-0)   - There's a `runApi` function that creates and starts runs, then processes jobs and their actions [2](#0-1)     However, the `runFlow` function being refactored appears to be part of a different flow execution system (in the `flows` directory) rather than the `runs` system shown in the available context.    ## Notes    Without access to the actual `run-flow.ts` file before and after the changes, I cannot provide specific details about how the refactoring improves the code structure or what the new helper functions do. The PR seems to be a code quality improvement focused on readability and maintainability rather than functional changes, as indicated by the testing instruction to run the existing test suite.

3082311072,Refactor trigger input processing to use typed parameters and webhook events,"## Summary  This PR refactors the trigger input processing system to replace generic payload handling with strongly-typed parameters and structured webhook events. This change improves type safety, eliminates ambiguous payload processing, and streamlines the flow execution pipeline.  ## Key Changes  ### 🔧 Type System Improvements - **Replaced `GenerationInput` with `ParameterItem`**: Transitioned from generic key-value inputs to typed parameter items with specific handling for `text`, `multiline-text`, and `number` types - **Introduced `GitHubWebhookEventInput`**: Added strongly-typed webhook event handling to replace generic payload inputs - **Enhanced type safety**: Added exhaustive type checking for input types to prevent runtime errors  ### 🌊 Flow Execution Refactoring - **Standardized trigger inputs**: Converted from mixed payload/input system to consistent `triggerInputs` array structure - **Streamlined GitHub webhook processing**: Direct webhook event processing without intermediate payload conversion - **Improved trigger resolution**: Direct output generation from typed inputs instead of building parameter items  ### 🔄 API Interface Changes - **Updated `runFlow` signature**: Changed from `payload?: unknown` and `triggerInputs?: GenerationContextInput` to `triggerInputs?: GenerationContextInput[]` - **Removed deprecated payload parameters**: Eliminated generic payload handling throughout the flow execution system - **Enhanced webhook event processing**: GitHub events now use structured `github-webhook-event` input type  ### 🎯 UI Component Updates - **Enhanced trigger input dialog**: Updated form processing to handle typed inputs with proper type conversion - **Improved parameter handling**: Added specific handling for different input types (text, multiline-text, number) with appropriate validation  ## Technical Details  ### Before ```typescript // Generic payload handling runFlow({   triggerId: trigger.id,   payload: githubEvent, // Untyped payload });  // Mixed input types const generationInputs: GenerationInput[] = []; for (const [key, value] of formData.entries()) {   generationInputs.push({     type: ""keyValue"",     name: key,     value: value.toString(),   }); } ```  ### After ```typescript // Structured webhook events runFlow({   triggerId: trigger.id,   triggerInputs: [{     type: ""github-webhook-event"",     webhookEvent: event, // Typed webhook event   }], });  // Typed parameter items const parameterItems: ParameterItem[] = []; switch (input.type) {   case ""text"":   case ""multiline-text"":     parameterItems.push({       type: ""string"",       name: input.name,       value: formDataEntryValue,     });     break;   case ""number"":     parameterItems.push({       type: ""number"",        name: input.name,       value: Number.parseInt(formDataEntryValue),     });     break; } ```  ## Files Changed  - **`packages/data-type/src/generation/context.ts`**: Updated generation context types - **`packages/giselle-engine/src/core/flows/`**: Refactored flow execution and trigger resolution - **`packages/giselle-engine/src/core/github/`**: Enhanced GitHub webhook handling with typed events - **`internal-packages/workflow-designer-ui/`**: Updated trigger input dialog with typed parameter processing  ## Testing  - ✅ `pnpm build-sdk` - SDK builds successfully - ⚠️ `pnpm check-types` - Network connectivity issues (ENOTFOUND registry.npmjs.org) - ⚠️ `pnpm test` - Network connectivity issues (ENOTFOUND registry.npmjs.org)  ## Migration Impact  This is a breaking change for: - Components using the old `GenerationInput` type - Flow execution systems expecting generic payload parameters - Webhook handlers using untyped payload processing  The migration path involves: 1. Replace `GenerationInput` usage with `ParameterItem` 2. Update flow execution calls to use structured `triggerInputs` arrays 3. Migrate webhook handlers to use `GitHubWebhookEventInput` type  ## Benefits  - **Improved Type Safety**: Eliminates runtime type errors through compile-time checking - **Better Developer Experience**: Clear, typed interfaces for trigger input processing - **Enhanced Maintainability**: Structured approach to webhook and parameter handling - **Consistent API**: Unified trigger input processing across all trigger types   ## Summary by CodeRabbit  - **New Features**   - Enhanced support for structured trigger inputs, allowing for both parameter-based and GitHub webhook event triggers.  - **Refactor**   - Unified and streamlined handling of trigger inputs across the application, improving reliability and maintainability.   - Manual and webhook-based triggers now use explicit, discriminated input types for greater clarity.   - Updated internal logic to extract and process trigger data more consistently.   - Simplified trigger resolution to focus on single output per event, improving event handling precision.   - Improved flow execution by removing deprecated payload parameters and aligning input types.   - Optimized parameter lookup and output construction for manual triggers.   - Ensured fresh data retrieval by bypassing cache in generation fetching.  - **Chores**   - Added a new development dependency for GitHub tooling.   - Removed unused code and debugging statements for cleaner operation.",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,OpenAI_Codex,internal quality attribute

3107487935,"Refactor: Modular architecture, migrate javscript code and test alignment","# Description    This PR restructures the codebase to follow a modular layered architecture, migrates all source files from JavaScript to TypeScript, and aligns the test structure and naming conventions with the production code. These changes are made to support future growth and maintainability as outlined in the project roadmap.    ## Key Changes    - **Architecture Refactor:**  Adopted a modular layered structure with clear separation between CLI, application, domain, and infrastructure layers. This improves code clarity, testability, and scalability.  - **TypeScript Migration**  All source files have been moved from JavaScript (.js) to TypeScript (.ts), enabling better type safety and developer experience.  - **Test Structure Alignment:**  Test folders and filenames now mirror the production code structure, using PascalCase for consistency. This makes it easier to locate and maintain tests as the project evolves.  - **Basic Unit Tests:**  Added simple unit tests for core modules (e.g., EnvilderFactory, [AwsSsmStoreSecrets](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/macal/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)) to ensure the test suite passes and to provide a foundation for future test coverage.    ## Motivation    These changes lay the groundwork for new features and increased complexity as described in the project roadmap. The new structure will make it easier to extend the CLI, add support for new secret stores, and maintain high code quality as the project grows.   ## Summary by CodeRabbit  - **New Features**   - Introduced a modular and extensible architecture for synchronizing environment variables from AWS SSM Parameter Store or other secret providers to local `.env` files.   - Added a builder pattern for flexible configuration of secret providers and environment file managers.   - Enhanced CLI workflow with improved logging and error handling.  - **Bug Fixes**   - Improved escaping of special characters in `.env` files to ensure correct formatting.  - **Chores**   - Migrated project scripts, CI workflows, and documentation from Yarn to npm.   - Updated package version and dependencies.   - Improved `.gitignore` and code formatting settings.  - **Documentation**   - Updated installation and usage instructions to focus on npm.   - Enhanced workflow and script documentation with clearer commands and thematic naming.  - **Tests**   - Added comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for new features and infrastructure.",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,OpenAI_Codex,internal quality attribute

3264944925,refactor: Continue dynamic moderation refactoring timeout arguments,"## Description  This PR advances the refactoring for a dynamic moderation system by completing the command-level configuration for various moderation commands.  **Summary of Changes:** - **Enhanced Command Configurations**: Explicitly added `supports_reason=True` and `supports_silent=True` flags to the `ModerationCommandConfig` entries for `warn`, `jail`, `unjail`, `unban`, `untimeout`, `snippetban`, `snippetunban`, `pollban`, and `pollunban` commands in `tux/cogs/moderation/command_config.py`. - **Development Environment Update**: Changed `python.languageServer` to `None` in `.vscode/settings.json`.  **Motivation and Context:** This change is a critical step in building a truly dynamic and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) moderation command system. By formalizing these flags within the `ModerationCommandConfig` dataclass, we ensure that all moderation commands have a consistent and explicit definition of their capabilities regarding reasons and silent execution. This completed configuration is foundational for the next phases, which involve automatically generating commands and unifying argument parsing, ultimately leading to significant code reduction, consistent user experience, and easier maintenance.  ## Guidelines  - My code follows the style guidelines of this project (formatted with Ruff) - I have performed a self-review of my own code - I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas - I have made corresponding changes to the documentation if needed - My changes generate no new warnings - I have tested this change - Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules - I have added all appropriate labels to this PR  - [ ] I have followed all of these guidelines.  ## How Has This Been Tested?

Key changes include:  *   **Removed v1 authentication shim**: The fallback to v1 authentication in `AuthMiddleware::authenticate_wallet_request` and `AuthMiddleware::authenticate_admin_request` was removed. Authentication now exclusively uses `external_api::auth::validate_expiring_auth`.  *   **Deleted legacy files**: `admin_auth.rs`, `wallet_auth.rs`, and `helpers.rs` were removed, as they contained v1-specific logic and helper functions.  *   **Dropped ""v2"" suffixes**: The `_v2` suffix was removed from authentication methods, as `validate_expiring_auth` is now the sole authentication mechanism.  *   **Code cleanup**: Unused imports (e.g., `tracing::warn`, `hyper::StatusCode`) and constants (`ERR_INVALID_PATH`) were removed from `mod.rs`.  *   **Test updates**: Related tests were updated to directly call `validate_expiring_auth` and reflect the new naming conventions.    This streamlines the authentication process, ensuring only the modern authentication method is used.    ### Testing  - [x] Unit tests pass  - [x] Testing in testnet","The changes described involve restructuring and simplifying the authentication code without adding new features or fixing bugs.

3216841824,Remove catch_unwind from clipboard typing,"``` ## Pull Request Template  ### Description Simplified the clipboard text input logic by removing the `catch_unwind` mechanism. The code now directly attempts clipboard input and falls back to key-by-key if an error is returned. The log level for the fallback message has been adjusted from `warn!` to `debug!` to reflect that these errors do not always indicate a functional failure.  ### Type of Change - [ ] Bug fix - [ ] New feature   - [ ] Breaking change - [ ] Documentation update - [x] Other: Code simplification and error handling refinement  ### Video Demo (Recommended) 🎥 **Please include a video demo** showing your changes in action! We might use it to post on social media and grow the community.  **Suggested editing tools:** - [Cap.so](https://cap.so/) - [Screen.studio](https://screen.studio/) - [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com/) - [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) - [Descript](https://www.descript.com/)   ### AI Review & Code Quality - [x] I asked AI to critique my PR and incorporated feedback - [x] I formatted my code properly - [x] I tested my changes locally  ### Checklist - [x] Code follows project style guidelines - [ ] Added video demo (recommended) - [ ] Updated documentation if needed  ### Additional Notes The `catch_unwind` block was removed to simplify the code, as the user reported that clipboard typing often succeeded despite the `warn!` messages. This change means that if the underlying `uiautomation` library *panics* (rather than returning an `Err`), the program will now crash instead of falling back. However, based on observed behavior, panics are not the primary cause of fallback, and the direct `Result` handling is sufficient and clearer. ```","The change simplifies the code by removing a catch_unwind mechanism and adjusts error handling and logging without adding features or fixing bugs.

3151015743,Update MCP server API endpoint,"The `path` parameter within the `mcp_http_app()` function in `api/api/routers/mcp/mcp_server.py` was updated from `""/sse""` to `""/""`. This change corrects the MCP server's exposed endpoint from `/mcp/sse/` to `/mcp/`, aligning it with the actual HTTP transport used instead of Server-Sent Events (SSE).    Correspondingly, the documentation in `api/api/routers/mcp/mcp_server_DOCS.md` was updated. All instances of `mcp/sse` in example URLs were changed to `mcp/` to reflect the new endpoint path.    This ensures the endpoint name accurately reflects the transport protocol. It is a breaking change for any existing MCP clients configured to use the `/mcp/sse/` path, requiring them to update to `/mcp/`.","The change updates the API endpoint path and corresponding documentation to reflect a new endpoint, which is a modification of existing functionality but does not add a new feature or fix a bug.

The `environment` parameter was enhanced with `Literal[""dev"", ""staging"", ""production""]` for improved type safety and its description was wrapped in `Field()`.  *   Tools already using `BaseModel` classes, such as `ask_ai_engineer` and `search_runs_by_metadata`, already conformed to the `Field(description=)` syntax and required no changes.

This ensures that URLs previously formatted as `.../runs?page=0&taskRunId=...` now appear as `.../runs?page=0&runId=...`, reflecting the updated parameter name in public routes as intended.

This refactoring addresses that by converting the codebase to an asynchronous model.    **Key Changes:**  *   **Asynchronous Core**: `terminal_bench/terminal/docker_compose_manager.py`, `terminal_bench/terminal/tmux_session.py`, and `terminal_bench/terminal/terminal.py` have been converted to use `async`/`await` patterns.  *   **Docker Client**: Replaced `docker` SDK with `aiodocker` for asynchronous Docker interactions.  *   **Subprocess Management**: Switched from `subprocess.run` to `anyio.run_process` for non-blocking subprocess execution.  *   **Concurrency**: `terminal_bench/harness/harness.py` now uses `anyio.create_task_group` and semaphores instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor` for managing concurrent trials.  *   **Simplified Cleanup**: Explicit signal handling for graceful shutdown was removed. `asyncio`'s built-in `CancelledError` propagation combined with `async with` context managers now ensures proper Docker resource cleanup on `KeyboardInterrupt` without additional complexity.  *   **CLI Updates**: Main CLI entry points (`tb runs create`, `tb tasks build`, `tb tasks interact`) are now wrapped with `asyncio.run()`.    **Benefits:**  *   **Reliable Cleanup**: Docker containers and images are now consistently cleaned up even when the process is interrupted.  *   **Improved Concurrency**: Better resource utilization and responsiveness through asynchronous I/O.  *   **Simpler Code**: Removal of unnecessary signal handling logic.    **Dependencies Added:**  *   `aiodocker>=0.22.2`  *   `anyio>=4.4.0`",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Cursor,internal quality attribute

3138797987,gui: Refactor useEffect to useMemo,"I asked Cursor to take a look at our `useEffect` calls and see if there are any that would be better as `useMemo`. From [the docs](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) on this:    > You don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering. For example, let’s say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will [“commit”](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit) these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect also immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.    This PR is a good start but it also found some more that are trickier to refactor because they involve lifting up other state or syncing state with the URL which should be handled with React Router. I'm going to create some follow-up issues and see if I can get Cursor to tackle those as well.    ---    For transparency, here's the initial prompt I gave Cursor.

Master-side RPC functions like `onWorkerError` and `onTestEnd` were implemented to handle worker events.  *   The worker process in `src/server/worker/start.ts` was updated to implement the `WorkerRPC` interface methods (`startTest`, `updateStories`, `shutdown`). Legacy `emitTestMessage` and `emitWorkerMessage` calls were replaced with RPC calls to the master (e.g., `masterRPC.onWorkerReady()`).    This refactoring provides type-safe, promise-based, and bidirectional communication, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable API for IPC.",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Cursor,internal quality attribute

These changes streamline the API response and frontend display, aligning with the architecture where structured output, JSON mode, and system messages are universally supported by all models.","The changes remove certain fields from the API response and update frontend interfaces and rendering logic accordingly, which is a modification to existing functionality but does not add new features or fix bugs.

3104285334,Move testing utilities to separate package,"# Move Testing Utilities to Separate Package  ## Problem Testing utilities were located in source directories and exported from main package entry points, causing test dependencies to be included in production builds.  ## Solution Created a new package `@faros-ai/airbyte-testing-tools` that consolidates all testing utilities from both `faros-airbyte-cdk` and `airbyte-faros-destination` packages. This isolates test dependencies from production code.  ### Changes - Created new package `@faros-ai/airbyte-testing-tools` with proper structure - Moved all testing utilities from both packages to the new package - Moved test-specific dependencies like `mockttp` and `tmp-promise` to the new package - Removed testing exports from main entry points - Updated all test files to import from the new package - Added the new package as a devDependency to both original packages  ### Benefits - Production builds no longer include test dependencies - Testing utilities are now properly isolated - Consistent testing API across packages - Easier maintenance of testing utilities  ## Testing The changes maintain the same API for all testing utilities, ensuring all existing tests continue to work without modification to their logic.

const [signupState, signupAction, isSignupPending] = useActionState(signup, undefined); ```  ### Zod Validation Schema Uses zod/v4 features for robust validation:  ```typescript export const AuthFormSchema = z.object({   email: z.string().email(""Invalid email address"").trim(),   password: z.string().min(8, { message: ""Be at least 8 characters long"" }).trim(), }); ```  ### Error Handling Server actions use `z.treeifyError()` to format validation errors for the UI:  ```typescript if (!validatedFields.success) {   const treeified = z.treeifyError(validatedFields.error);   return { errors: treeified.properties }; } ```  ## Breaking Changes None - this is a new authentication system implementation.  ## Next Steps - Configure Supabase environment variables for full functionality - Add additional auth features (password reset, email verification) - Integrate with existing user management flows  ---  **Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/733fe60b7d4f4c509d30b85a131cf14a  **Requested by**: Yadong (Adam) Zhang (zhyd007@gmail.com)",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Devin,internal quality attribute

Essentially, now there are two implementations of the same check. Eventually, we may choose to delete stuff in Airbyte CI, but I am holding off for now. The downside of this change is that Airbyte CI will now run the version increment check logic twice. Once as a standalone step and again as part of the qa check step.

This separates concerns between `brev start` (for starting existing instances) and `brev create` (for creating new instances).  **Key Changes:** - **Removed creation-related flags**: `--name`, `--cpu`, `--gpu`, `--setup-script`, `--setup-repo`, `--setup-path`, `--org`, `--empty` - **Kept only**: `--detached` flag for non-blocking start operations   - **Removed creation functions**: `maybeStartEmpty`, `maybeStartFromGitURL`, `maybeStartWithLocalPath`, `createEmptyWorkspace`, `createNewWorkspaceFromGit`, `MakeNewWorkspaceFromURL`, and related creation logic - **Simplified interfaces**: Updated `StartStore` to remove creation-related methods - **Updated help text**: Changed terminology from ""machine"" to ""instance"" and updated examples with `instance_name` placeholder - **Fixed dependencies**: Implemented `makeGitRepoFromURL` in `profile.go` to replace dependency on removed `start.MakeNewWorkspaceFromURL`  This is a **breaking change** - users attempting to create workspaces with `brev start` will now receive error messages directing them to use `brev create`.  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  - [ ] **Test existing functionality**: Verify `brev start ` still works correctly for stopped instances - [ ] **Test error handling**: Try `brev start ` and `brev start` with no args to confirm error messages are helpful and direct users to `brev create` - [ ] **Test detached flag**: Verify `brev start  --detached` works and doesn't block the shell - [ ] **Verify create command unaffected**: Test that `brev create` command still works properly for workspace creation - [ ] **Check for hidden dependencies**: Search codebase for any other references to removed functions like `MakeNewWorkspaceFromURL`, `maybeStartEmpty`, etc.  **Recommended test plan**: Create a test instance with `brev create`, stop it, then start it with `brev start` to verify the full workflow still works end-to-end.  ---  ### Diagram  ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TD     StartCmd[""pkg/cmd/start/start.goNewCmdStart()""]:::major-edit     StartStore[""StartStore interface""]:::major-edit     RunStart[""runStartWorkspace()""]:::major-edit     MaybeStart[""maybeStartStoppedOrJoin()""]:::context          StartTest[""pkg/cmd/start/start_test.go""]:::minor-edit     ProfileCmd[""pkg/cmd/profile/profile.go""]:::minor-edit     CreateCmd[""pkg/cmd/create/create.go""]:::context          StartCmd --> StartStore     StartCmd --> RunStart     RunStart --> MaybeStart          StartTest -.-> StartCmd     ProfileCmd -.-> StartCmd          subgraph ""Removed Functions""          RemovedFuncs[""maybeStartEmpty()maybeStartFromGitURL()createEmptyWorkspace()MakeNewWorkspaceFromURL()""]:::removed     end          StartCmd -.->|""removed dependencies""| RemovedFuncs     ProfileCmd -.->|""replaced withmakeGitRepoFromURL()""| RemovedFuncs          subgraph Legend         L1[Major Edit]:::major-edit         L2[Minor Edit]:::minor-edit           L3[Context/No Edit]:::context         L4[Removed]:::removed     end      classDef major-edit fill:#90EE90     classDef minor-edit fill:#87CEEB       classDef context fill:#FFFFFF     classDef removed fill:#FFB6C1 ```  ### Notes  - All CI checks are passing (6/6) including lint, tests, and security scans - This change maintains backward compatibility for the core `brev start` functionality while removing the creation aspect - The `--detached` flag behavior is preserved for non-blocking operations - Error messages provide clear guidance to users about using `brev create` for workspace creation  **Link to Devin run:** https://app.devin.ai/sessions/8102944e41954c7b86d9860ea4b8adc4   **Requested by:** @theFong","The PR primarily restructures the code by removing workspace creation logic from the 'brev start' command and simplifying interfaces, without adding new features or fixing bugs.

3250731596,Remove generic operation schemas with v.any() for improved type safety,"## Issue    - resolve: https://github.com/route06/liam-internal/issues/5095    ## Why is this change needed?    This change improves type safety by removing generic operation schemas that used `v.any()` from the db-structure package. The generic schemas (`addOperationSchema`, `removeOperationSchema`, `replaceOperationSchema`, `moveOperationSchema`, `copyOperationSchema`, `testOperationSchema`) allowed any value type, which defeats the purpose of TypeScript's type checking. By removing these and keeping only the properly typed operation schemas (table, column, index, constraint operations), we ensure stronger type safety throughout the codebase.    ## What changed?    ### Core schema changes  - **Removed 6 generic operation schemas** from `frontend/packages/db-structure/src/operation/schema/index.ts` that used `v.any()` for their value fields  - **Updated operationSchema union** to only include properly typed operations: `tableOperations`, `columnOperations`, `indexOperations`, `constraintOperations`    ### Related fixes  - **Fixed TypeScript compilation error** in `operationDeparser.ts` where the fallback case now correctly handles the narrowed operation type  - **Updated VersionMessage component** to remove switch cases for the deleted operation types (`move`, `copy`, `test`)    ## ⚠️ Breaking Change Notice    This is a breaking change that removes support for generic operation types. The removed operation types are:  - `add` (generic)  - `remove` (generic)   - `replace` (generic)  - `move`  - `copy`  - `test`    Specific typed operations for tables, columns, indexes, and constraints remain fully supported.    ## Review Focus Areas    **🔍 High Priority**  - [ ] Verify no other components reference the removed operation types (`move`, `copy`, `test`, or generic `add`/`remove`/`replace`)  - [ ] Confirm backend/database systems don't expect the removed operation types in JSON patches  - [ ] Review the TypeScript fix in `operationDeparser.ts` - is the generic error message appropriate?    **🧪 Testing**  - [ ] All existing tests pass ✅ (289/289 tests passed)  - [ ] Linting passes ✅ (all 26 tasks successful)  - [ ] Consider edge cases where removed operation types might be processed at runtime    **🤔 Questions for Review**  - Are there any integration points (APIs, database, external systems) that might still send the removed operation types?  - Should we consider a more gradual deprecation approach instead of immediate removal?    ---    **Link to Devin run:** https://app.devin.ai/sessions/04f072d0348b4a73999ead41730aa910    **Requested by:** @MH4GF","The PR removes generic operation schemas and updates the code to improve type safety, which is a refactor since it changes the code structure without adding new features or fixing bugs.",API / Interface Refactoring,Devin,internal quality attribute

Run `airbyte-ci connectors build` on a sample Python connector (e.g., source-faker) 2. Run `airbyte-ci connectors build` on a sample Java connector   3. Verify base image builds complete successfully 4.

Other hourly jobs (`cleanupDanglingFiles` and `closeInactiveConversations`) remain on the hourly schedule as they serve different purposes.  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  - [ ] **Verify timezone calculation**: Confirm that `""0 14 * * 1-5""` correctly represents 9am EST (EST = UTC-5, so 9am EST = 2pm UTC = hour 14) - [ ] **Test alert timing in production**: After deployment, monitor that alerts are sent at 9am EST on weekdays, not hourly - [ ] **Validate cron syntax**: Ensure the expression `""0 14 * * 1-5""` works correctly (Monday=1 through Friday=5) - [ ] **Check for dependencies**: Verify no other systems or workflows depend on these alerts running hourly - [ ] **Test alert functionality**: Confirm the actual alert content and Slack posting still works correctly  **Recommended test plan**: Deploy to staging first, then monitor for 2-3 business days to ensure alerts are sent at the correct time and frequency.  ---  ### Diagram  ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TD     A[""jobs/index.ts(cronJobs config)""]:::major-edit     B[""checkAssignedTicketResponseTimes.ts(alert job)""]:::context     C[""checkVipResponseTimes.ts(alert job)""]:::context     D[""db/setupCron.ts(cron setup)""]:::context     E[""Database(pgmq jobs)""]:::context     F[""Slack Alerts(9am EST M-F)""]:::context      A -->|""schedules""| B     A -->|""schedules""| C     A -->|""read by""| D     D -->|""configures""| E     E -->|""executes""| B     E -->|""executes""| C     B -->|""posts to""| F     C -->|""posts to""| F      subgraph Legend         L1[Major Edit]:::major-edit         L2[Minor Edit]:::minor-edit         L3[Context/No Edit]:::context     end      classDef major-edit fill:#90EE90     classDef minor-edit fill:#87CEEB     classDef context fill:#FFFFFF ```  ### Notes  - Both job functions already have built-in weekend checking logic (e.g., `checkAssignedTicketResponseTimes` returns early if `isWeekend(now)`), so the weekday-only cron schedule aligns with existing behavior - The change will only take effect after deployment when `db/setupCron.ts` runs to update the database cron configuration - Unable to test locally due to environment permission issues with docker/redis directories - Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/9f74633b7762460ea7325eae31b12d38 - Requested by: sahil.lavingia@gmail.com","The PR changes the scheduling of existing alert jobs to run at a different time and frequency, which is a modification to the behavior of existing features rather than a bug fix or new feature.

The React hooks now use client methods like `client.conversations.list()` instead of making direct fetch requests.  **Key Changes:** - **New Package**: Created `@helperai/client` with a `HelperClient` class containing organized API methods - **API Extraction**: Moved all fetch logic from React hooks (`useConversations`, `useConversation`, `useCreateConversation`, `useCreateSession`, `useUpdateConversation`) to client methods - **Dependency Update**: React package now depends on the client package - **Authentication Refactor**: Modified `HelperContext` to create and provide a `HelperClient` instance - **Type Consolidation**: Moved shared TypeScript interfaces to the client package  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  - [ ] **Test authentication flow end-to-end** - Verify widget sessions are created correctly and API calls are authenticated properly - [ ] **Test all API endpoints** - Ensure conversations list, get, create, update, and session creation all work as expected - [ ] **Verify error handling** - Check that network errors and API errors are handled the same way as before - [ ] **Check TypeScript compilation** - Ensure no type errors in consuming applications and all exports are available - [ ] **Test build process** - Verify both packages build successfully and the React package can consume the client package  **Recommended Test Plan:** 1. Start the development server and test the widget functionality 2. Create a new conversation and verify messages load correctly 3. Test conversation updates and marking as read 4.

The `repositories` annotation in `langGraphUtils.ts` was defined but unused in the workflow state.

All code references have been systematically identified and removed.  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  - [ ] **Run the migration locally** - Verify `rails db:migrate` executes without errors and properly drops the table - [ ] **Test admin interface** - Navigate to `/admin` and verify all pages load without errors, especially user and company detail pages - [ ] **Run full test suite** - Execute complete test suite to catch any missed references that cause failures - [ ] **Search verification** - Perform additional search for `time_entries`, `TimeEntry`, `time_entry` to confirm no references were missed - [ ] **Frontend compilation** - Verify frontend builds and loads without route helper errors  **Recommended Test Plan**: Start local development server, navigate through admin interface (users, companies, settings), and verify no time_entries related errors appear in logs or UI.  ---  ### Diagram  ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TB     Migration[""db/migrate/..._drop_time_entries.rb(DROP TABLE)""]:::major-edit          TimeEntryModel[""app/models/time_entry.rb(DELETED)""]:::major-edit     AdminController[""app/controllers/admin/time_entries_controller.rb(DELETED)""]:::major-edit     Dashboard[""app/dashboards/time_entry_dashboard.rb(DELETED)""]:::major-edit          UserModel[""app/models/user.rb(removed has_many)""]:::minor-edit     CompanyModel[""app/models/company.rb(removed has_many)""]:::minor-edit          Routes[""config/routes.rb(removed admin resource)""]:::minor-edit          FrontendRoutes[""frontend/utils/routes.jsfrontend/utils/routes.d.ts(removed helpers)""]:::major-edit          UserDashboard[""app/dashboards/user_dashboard.rb(removed field)""]:::minor-edit     CompanyDashboard[""app/dashboards/company_dashboard.rb(removed field)""]:::minor-edit          PurgeService[""app/services/purge_seed_data.rb(removed cleanup)""]:::minor-edit          Migration --> TimeEntryModel     TimeEntryModel --> UserModel     TimeEntryModel --> CompanyModel     AdminController --> Routes     Dashboard --> UserDashboard     Dashboard --> CompanyDashboard     TimeEntryModel --> PurgeService     Routes --> FrontendRoutes          subgraph Legend         L1[""Major Edit(File deleted/created)""]:::major-edit         L2[""Minor Edit(References removed)""]:::minor-edit         L3[""Context/No Edit""]:::context     end          classDef major-edit fill:#90EE90     classDef minor-edit fill:#87CEEB     classDef context fill:#FFFFFF ```  ### Notes  - **Data Loss Warning**: This migration permanently drops the `time_entries` table and all its data - **Local test failures**: The local RSpec tests failed broadly (not just time_entries related), suggesting potential environment issues that didn't affect the actual migration - **Auto-generated routes**: Frontend route helpers appear to be auto-generated, so manual removal may need verification - **Migration dependencies**: Had to clean up references in other migrations (timestamp defaults) indicating potential for other hidden dependencies  **Session Details**:  - Requested by: @slavingia - Devin session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/8ff5afc1b9f1424c82b603adadd33596","The PR removes an entire feature including database table, models, controllers, routes, and tests, which is a code removal and cleanup rather than adding a new feature or fixing a bug.

3241712681,refactor: replace try-catch with neverthrow in deepModeling function,"# Replace try-catch with neverthrow Result type in deepModeling function  ## Summary  Refactored the `deepModeling` function in `frontend/internal-packages/agent/src/deepModeling.ts` to replace try-catch error handling with neverthrow's functional Result type pattern. This change aligns with the existing codebase patterns and satisfies the ESLint rule that prohibits try-catch statements in the `@liam-hq/agent` package.  **Key Changes:** - Removed try-catch block from `deepModeling` function - Implemented `ResultAsync` chain using `fromPromise`, `andThen`, and `orElse` - Added `convertWorkflowRunResult` helper function to convert repository result patterns - Fixed error propagation to preserve original error messages from mocked failures - Used `ResultAsync.fromPromise` instead of `fromSafePromise` to properly handle workflow exceptions  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  **⚠️ Critical items to verify (High Risk - 4 items):**  - [ ] **Error handling behavior**: Manually test error scenarios to ensure the workflow still fails gracefully with meaningful error messages when dependencies (repository operations, agent invocations) fail - [ ] **Error message preservation**: Verify that original error messages from failed operations are preserved through the neverthrow chain and reach the final result/logs - [ ] **Workflow execution consistency**: Test that successful workflow execution produces the same results as before the refactor - [ ] **Integration testing**: Run end-to-end tests or manual testing of the deep modeling feature to ensure the refactor doesn't break integration with the broader system  **Recommended test plan:** 1. Run the full test suite locally: `cd frontend/internal-packages/agent && pnpm test` 2. Test error scenarios by temporarily introducing failures in dependencies 3. Verify error logging and responses contain meaningful messages 4.

Each endpoint now has its own dedicated file and corresponding unit tests, following the established pattern in the codebase.  **Key Changes:** - Split `SlackHandler` class into 6 individual handler functions - Created separate files: `initiate-oauth.ts`, `handle-oauth-callback.ts`, `get-integration.ts`, `remove-integration.ts`, `update-integration.ts`, `get-channels.ts` - Added comprehensive unit tests for each new handler (co-located `.test.ts` files) - Updated route definitions in `index.ts` to use the new handler functions - Added missing `updateIntegrationSettings` function to `slack-helpers.ts` - Removed old `handler.ts` and `handler.test.ts` files - Updated integration tests to work with new structure  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The following items must be verified as I encountered package resolution issues that prevented full testing:  - [ ] **Run the unit tests**: Execute `pnpm run test apps/server/src/api/v2/slack/` and ensure all tests pass - [ ] **Verify build succeeds**: Run `turbo run build --filter=@buster-app/server` to ensure no import/build errors - [ ] **Test Slack OAuth flow end-to-end**: Initiate OAuth, complete callback, verify integration works - [ ] **Check error scenarios**: Test invalid requests, authentication failures, and integration not found cases - [ ] **Verify integration tests pass**: Run the `.int.test.ts` files to ensure they work with new structure  **Recommended Test Plan:** 1. Start the server locally and test each Slack endpoint manually 2. Verify the OAuth flow works from initiation through callback completion 3. Test error scenarios (invalid tokens, missing integrations, etc.) 4. Confirm existing Slack integrations continue to work  ---  ### Diagram  ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TD     subgraph ""apps/server/src/api/v2/slack/""         Index[""index.ts(Route Definitions)""]:::major-edit                  subgraph ""New Handler Files""             InitOAuth[""initiate-oauth.ts""]:::major-edit             HandleCallback[""handle-oauth-callback.ts""]:::major-edit             GetIntegration[""get-integration.ts""]:::major-edit             RemoveIntegration[""remove-integration.ts""]:::major-edit             UpdateIntegration[""update-integration.ts""]:::major-edit             GetChannels[""get-channels.ts""]:::major-edit         end                  subgraph ""Services (Updated)""             SlackHelpers[""services/slack-helpers.ts""]:::minor-edit             SlackOAuth[""services/slack-oauth-service.ts""]:::context         end                  subgraph ""Removed Files""             OldHandler[""handler.ts (DELETED)""]:::major-edit         end     end          Index --> InitOAuth     Index --> HandleCallback     Index --> GetIntegration     Index --> RemoveIntegration     Index --> UpdateIntegration     Index --> GetChannels          InitOAuth --> SlackOAuth     HandleCallback --> SlackOAuth     GetIntegration --> SlackOAuth     RemoveIntegration --> SlackOAuth     UpdateIntegration --> SlackHelpers     GetChannels --> SlackOAuth          subgraph Legend         L1[Major Edit]:::major-edit         L2[Minor Edit]:::minor-edit         L3[Context/No Edit]:::context     end  classDef major-edit fill:#90EE90 classDef minor-edit fill:#87CEEB classDef context fill:#FFFFFF ```  ### Notes  - **Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/ebb9a62974f24e7d875b3594f6b319eb - **Requested by**: @dallinbentley - **Testing limitation**: Package resolution issues prevented full test verification during development - **No logic changes**: The refactoring preserves all existing functionality and error handling patterns - **Follow-up**: Consider moving more shared logic to the `@buster/slack` package as originally requested, though no obvious duplicates were found in this scope",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Devin,internal quality attribute

3275585352,Remove boilerplate log messages from AI workflow nodes,"## Issue  - resolve: Remove specific boilerplate log message ""Designing your database structure to meet the identified requirements..."" from designSchemaNode since reasoning-based logging is now available  ## Why is this change needed?  The user requested removing the specific boilerplate log message from designSchemaNode.ts because reasoning-based logging is now available, making the generic status message unnecessary. The reasoning system provides much more meaningful and specific context about what the AI is actually doing during database schema design.  ## What changed  Removed the initial boilerplate log message from `designSchemaNode.ts`: ```typescript // Removed this boilerplate message: await logAssistantMessage(   state,   repositories,   'Designing your database structure to meet the identified requirements...',   assistantRole, ) ```  The reasoning-based logging functionality remains intact (lines 81-90 in designSchemaNode.ts) which provides much more specific and useful feedback to users about the actual schema design process.  ## Review checklist  **Critical items to verify:**  - [ ] **Scope validation**: Confirm that only the specific message from designSchemaNode.ts was removed (not other similar messages from other workflow nodes) - [ ] **User experience testing**: Test the schema design workflow to ensure reasoning-based logs provide adequate user feedback and users aren't left without status updates - [ ] **Reasoning coverage**: Verify that designSchemaNode consistently generates reasoning summaries in typical usage scenarios - [ ] **Functional testing**: Run through the database design workflow to ensure no regressions in functionality or user experience  **Technical review:** - [ ] All error handling and retry logic preserved correctly - [ ] Code formatting and linting passes (✅ verified) - [ ] No unintended changes to other workflow nodes  ## Notes  - Initial implementation incorrectly removed similar messages from 5 other workflow nodes, but this was corrected after user feedback - Pre-commit hooks and linting passed successfully - No functional logic was modified, only the specific log message removal - The change affects user-facing messaging, so UX validation is important  ---  **Requested by:** @MH4GF (hirotaka.miyagi@route06.co.jp)   **Link to Devin run:** https://app.devin.ai/sessions/fbbf419142584525b8537b3ad015bd33","The change involves removing a specific log message without adding new features or fixing bugs, focusing on improving user experience by eliminating redundant boilerplate logs.

3276005639,🔥 Remove unnecessary buildingSchemaVersionId from LangGraph annotations,"## Issue  - resolve: #5174  ## Why is this change needed?  The `buildingSchemaVersionId` field was defined in LangGraph workflow annotations but not actually used by the tools, creating unnecessary complexity in the workflow state management. According to the investigation in #5174:  1. **Timeline creation**: Uses `buildingSchemaVersionId` directly from newly created schema versions, not from workflow state 2. **Tool configuration**: The `toolConfigurableSchema` only requires `buildingSchemaId` and `latestVersionNumber`  3. **Tool execution**: `schemaDesignTool` only uses the two fields above, not `buildingSchemaVersionId`  ## Changes  ### Core Removals - **langGraphUtils.ts**: Removed `buildingSchemaVersionId: Annotation` from LangGraph annotations - **types.ts**: Removed `buildingSchemaVersionId?: string | undefined` from `WorkflowState` type definition   - **invokeSchemaDesignToolNode.ts**: Removed unused `buildingSchemaVersionId` from tool configuration  ### Impact Analysis - ✅ **UI Components**: No impact - `VersionMessage`, `TimelineItem` etc. use separate data flow via database queries - ✅ **Database Operations**: No impact - timeline creation gets `buildingSchemaVersionId` directly from schema version creation - ✅ **Tool Functionality**: No impact - `schemaDesignTool` only requires `buildingSchemaId` and `latestVersionNumber`  ## Human Review Checklist  ⚠️ **Critical Areas to Verify:**  1. **End-to-end workflow testing**: Run a complete schema design workflow to ensure no runtime errors occur 2. **Integration test review**: Check if `designSchemaNode.integration.test.ts` needs updates (contains comment referencing the removed field) 3. **Tool invocation**: Verify `schemaDesignTool` still executes correctly with simplified configuration 4. **State transitions**: Confirm LangGraph state management handles the removed annotation gracefully 5. **Error handling**: Ensure no code paths attempt to access the removed `buildingSchemaVersionId` field  ## Risk Assessment  **Medium Risk** - While static analysis suggests safe removal, LangGraph workflows have complex runtime behavior that's difficult to fully verify without comprehensive testing.  ---  **Session Details:** - Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/aba7760fcc0b43728dee071e50ad5008 - Requested by: @MH4GF","The PR removes an unused field from the codebase, simplifying the workflow state management without adding new features or fixing bugs.

3276569103,Improve deepModeling.ts error handling: implement immediate error recording and workflow stopping,"## Issue  - resolve: route06/liam-internal#5161  ## Why is this change needed?  The current deepModeling.ts workflow has a delayed error handling pattern where errors are stored in `state.error` and only processed later in `finalizeArtifactsNode`. This approach has several problems: 1. **Delayed error recording** - Errors aren't logged to timeline immediately when they occur, losing timing context 2. **Workflow continues after errors** - The workflow keeps running even after unrecoverable errors, wasting resources 3. **Complex error state management** - Error state is carried through the entire workflow unnecessarily  This PR implements immediate error handling using LangGraph Command pattern to stop workflows immediately and record errors to timeline items as soon as they occur.  ## What Changed  ### Core Architecture Changes - **Removed `error` field from `WorkflowState` type** - Eliminates delayed error state management - **Added `handleImmediateError` utility** - Creates timeline items immediately and stops workflow using Command pattern - **Updated all workflow nodes** to use immediate error handling instead of `state.error` assignments  ### Key Files Modified - `src/chat/workflow/types.ts` - Removed error field from WorkflowState - `src/shared/workflowSetup.ts` - Added handleImmediateError function - `src/chat/workflow/nodes/*` - Updated all 6 workflow nodes for immediate error handling - `src/createGraph.ts` - Removed state.error dependency from conditional routing - `src/chat/workflow/nodes/finalizeArtifactsNode.ts` - Removed delayed error handling logic  ### Error Handling Flow (Before vs After)  ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TD     A[Node Error Occurs] --> B[Set state.error]     B --> C[Continue Workflow]     C --> D[Other Nodes Execute]     D --> E[finalizeArtifactsNode]     E --> F[Check state.error]     F --> G[Record Error to Timeline]     G --> H[End Workflow]          style A fill:#ffcccc     style B fill:#ffcccc     style C fill:#ffcccc     style D fill:#ffcccc ```  **After (Immediate Error Handling):** ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TD     A[Node Error Occurs] --> B[handleImmediateError]     B --> C[Record to Timeline Immediately]     C --> D[Return Command with goto: END]     D --> E[Workflow Stops Immediately]          style A fill:#ffcccc     style B fill:#ccffcc     style C fill:#ccffcc     style D fill:#ccffcc     style E fill:#ccffcc ```  ## Human Review Checklist  **🔴 High Priority - Core Logic** - [ ] Verify `handleImmediateError` function correctly creates timeline items and workflow run status updates - [ ] Confirm Command pattern usage with `goto: END` properly stops workflow execution - [ ] Search entire codebase for any remaining `state.error` references that might have been missed  **🟡 Medium Priority - Node Conversions**   - [ ] Review all 6 workflow nodes (analyzeRequirements, designSchema, generateUsecase, prepareDml, validateSchema, webSearch) for correct error handling conversion - [ ] Verify configuration error handling - nodes now throw when `getConfigurable` fails instead of trying to record errors - [ ] Check that successful paths in nodes no longer set `error: undefined`  **🟢 Lower Priority - Supporting Changes** - [ ] Test file changes - verify property existence checks work correctly for `WorkflowState | Command` return types - [ ] Script updates - confirm `executeDeepModelingProcess.ts` and `executeDesignProcess.ts` no longer reference removed error field - [ ] Conditional routing in `createGraph.ts` - ensure workflow routes correctly without `state.error` dependency  ## Testing Notes  ⚠️ **Testing Limitation**: Due to the complexity of the full workflow setup, end-to-end testing of error scenarios wasn't performed. The changes were verified through: - Static analysis and code review - Lint/type checking (all passed) - Unit test updates for new return types  **Recommended Manual Testing:** 1.

Database Type Refactoring - **Before**: Manual definition of Row/Insert/Update types for each table - **After**: Generic `CreateTableType` utility that automatically generates these types from Prisma models - **Benefits**:    - Reduces code duplication (62 lines → 38 lines, 80% rewrite)   - Easier to maintain when adding new tables   - Consistent type generation across all tables  ### 2. Fixed Null Handling Issues - **Problem**: Optional fields like `description` and `invited_by` were causing TypeScript errors - **Solution**: Made Insert types use `Partial>` to properly handle optional fields - **Result**: Removed `@ts-expect-error` directives and FIXME comments  ## Files Changed - `apps/web/types/model.ts` - Refactored Database type with generic utility - `apps/web/app/actions/workspaces.ts` - Removed FIXME comments and type errors  ## Testing - ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors - ✅ All existing functionality preserved - ✅ Lint-staged hooks passed during commit  ## Technical Details The new `CreateTableType` utility: - Uses Prisma model types directly for `Row` - Creates `Insert` types that omit auto-generated fields and make all remaining fields optional - Creates `Update` types that make all fields partial  This approach automatically handles optional fields based on the Prisma schema definitions, eliminating the need for manual type adjustments when database schema changes.  ---  **Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/776408b80c804e0f886ed3e863a0cef5  **Requested by**: Yadong (Adam) Zhang (zhyd007@gmail.com)",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Devin,internal quality attribute

3220799500,Refactor AppHarness to use reflex run subprocess instead of threads,"# Refactor AppHarness to use subprocess instead of threads  ## Summary  This PR refactors the `AppHarness` class in `reflex/testing.py` to use `reflex run` in a subprocess instead of thread-based server management. This aligns better with how Reflex apps normally run (using granian by default) and reduces custom code maintenance burden.  **Key Changes:** - Replaced thread-based `_start_backend` and `_start_frontend` methods with subprocess-based `_start_subprocess` - Added `_wait_for_servers` method that parses console output to detect server readiness using regex patterns - Implemented `shell=True` approach for subprocess to properly capture stdout/stderr from `reflex run` - Added proper process cleanup in `stop()` method to terminate subprocesses - Fixed all darglint documentation errors for parameter and return type documentation - Maintained API compatibility where possible (state management methods now raise `NotImplementedError`)  **Current Status:** - All 12 integration-app-harness CI tests are still failing, but this is expected as the refactoring is not yet complete - Local testing shows the subprocess implementation correctly starts servers and detects readiness - All pre-commit checks (darglint, ruff, pyright) are now passing  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  **🔴 High Risk - 5 items to verify:**  - [ ] **Test subprocess implementation locally**: Run integration tests locally to verify servers start correctly and process cleanup works (no hanging `reflex run` processes after tests) - [ ] **Verify console output parsing reliability**: Test that the regex patterns in `_wait_for_servers` correctly detect ""App running at:"" and ""Backend running at:"" messages across different environments - [ ] **Check process cleanup edge cases**: Test that subprocess termination works correctly when tests fail or are interrupted (e.g., with Ctrl+C) - [ ] **Test with different state managers**: Verify the refactored AppHarness works with both memory and Redis state managers - [ ] **Validate API compatibility**: Check that existing tests that use `app_harness.get_state()` still work correctly with the new subprocess approach  **Recommended Test Plan:** 1. Run `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_input.py::test_fully_controlled_input -v -s` locally 2. Check `ps aux | grep reflex` before and after tests to verify no hanging processes 3. Test with `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379` to verify Redis state manager compatibility 4.

Optimizations:    * Configured dynamic parallelism for test execution    * Removed redundant task executions through proper task exclusions    * Disabled SpotBugs from running as part of check command (now runs separately in matrix)  3. Matrix Configuration: ```yaml strategy:   matrix:     gradle-task:        - name: compile         command: compileJava compileKotlin compileTestJava compileTestKotlin       - name: spotbugs         command: spotbugsMain spotbugsTest       - name: unit-tests         command: test -x spotbugsMain -x spotbugsTest -x compileJava -x compileKotlin -x compileTestJava -x compileTestKotlin       - name: integration-tests         command: integrationTest -x test -x spotbugsMain -x spotbugsTest -x compileJava -x compileKotlin -x compileTestJava -x compileTestKotlin ```  ### Benefits - More granular build feedback (each job reports separately) - Parallel execution of different build phases - Clearer failure points in CI - Reduced redundant task execution  ### Testing - Changes have been tested through the GitHub Actions workflow - Matrix jobs execute independently and in parallel - Task exclusions prevent redundant work  Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/cda9804199364961b57efb80ae11fcc0",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Devin,internal quality attribute
3102500944,Refactor visualization to use procedural API with BaseVisualizationModel,"# Refactor Visualization to Use Procedural API  ## Overview This PR decouples the visualization system from the Kura instance, creating a new `BaseVisualizationModel` abstract base class and refactoring the `ClusterVisualizer` to accept clusters directly. This follows the procedural API pattern used in other parts of the codebase.  ## Changes - Created a new `BaseVisualizationModel` abstract base class in `kura/base_classes/visualization.py` - Updated `kura/base_classes/__init__.py` to include the new base class - Refactored `ClusterVisualizer` to inherit from `BaseVisualizationModel` - Removed dependency on Kura instance in the constructor - Made visualization methods accept clusters directly as parameters - Added helper methods for loading clusters from checkpoint files - Ensured methods are configurable with parameters instead of relying on instance state  ## Motivation The previous implementation was tightly coupled with the Kura instance, making it difficult to use the visualization functionality independently. This refactoring follows the procedural API pattern used in other parts of the codebase, allowing for more flexible usage.  ## New API Usage ```python # Create a visualizer visualizer = ClusterVisualizer()  # Visualize clusters directly visualizer.visualize_clusters(clusters=my_clusters, style=""rich"")  # Or load from checkpoint visualizer.visualize_clusters(checkpoint_path=""path/to/checkpoint.jsonl"", style=""enhanced"") ```  ## Testing The implementation maintains the same visualization capabilities while providing a more flexible API. The code has been tested to ensure it compiles without errors.

3141537681,refactor: consolidate WormholeContract into single impl block,"# Refactor WormholeContract to use single impl block  ## Summary This PR refactors the Wormhole contract in the Stylus implementation to improve code clarity and structure by consolidating multiple impl blocks into a single impl block, as requested in the code review feedback.  ## Changes Made - **Consolidated impl blocks**: ✅ Successfully merged the separate `impl WormholeContract` and `impl IWormhole for WormholeContract` blocks into a single unified impl block - **Fixed compilation issues**:    - Fixed type error in `initialize` function by using `U256::from(0)` instead of `0`   - Fixed unsafe attribute in `main.rs` by wrapping with `unsafe(...)` - **Preserved functionality**: All existing methods and functionality remain unchanged  ## Technical Investigation: Individual Function `#[public]` Annotations  **Original Request**: Use a single impl block WITHOUT `#[public]` on the impl block itself, but WITH individual functions marked `#[public]`.  **Investigation Results**: ❌ **Not supported by current Stylus SDK**  ### Attempted Approach ```rust impl WormholeContract {  // No #[public] here     #[public]           // Individual function annotation     pub fn initialize(...) { ... }          #[public]           // Individual function annotation       pub fn get_chain_id(...) { ... }     // ... other functions } ```  ### Compilation Errors ``` error: expected `impl`    --> contracts/wormhole/src/lib.rs:141:5     | 141 |     pub fn initialize(     |     ^^^  error[E0599]: no associated item named `__stylus_assert_overrides` found for struct `WormholeContract` error[E0277]: the trait bound `WormholeContract: Router<_>` is not satisfied ```  ### Root Cause The current Stylus SDK requires `#[public]` to be applied to the **entire impl block**, not individual functions. Without `#[public]` on the impl block, the `#[entrypoint]` macro cannot find the required traits (`Router`, `__stylus_assert_overrides`).  ## Current Working Solution - ✅ **Single consolidated impl block** (as requested) - ✅ **`#[public]` on entire impl block** (Stylus SDK requirement) - ✅ **Code compiles successfully** with `cargo build` - ✅ **All functionality preserved** - ✅ **No behavioral changes introduced**  ## Testing - ✅ Code compiles successfully with `cargo build` - ✅ All existing functionality preserved - ✅ No behavioral changes introduced - ✅ Comprehensive testing of both approaches (individual vs block-level `#[public]`)  ## Link to Devin run https://app.devin.ai/sessions/9561fe072961457792deaa66c8e561a7  **Requested by**: ayush.suresh@dourolabs.xyz",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Devin,internal quality attribute

The file is a critical development tool that automatically generates type annotations for Blender property classes throughout the VRM addon codebase.  **Key Changes:** - **Code Quality Improvements**: Replaced single-letter variables with meaningful names, split long functions into smaller focused functions, added comprehensive type hints and docstrings - **Function Naming**: Removed underscore prefixes from all `_handle_*` functions (now `handle_*`) per user request - **Constant Consolidation**: Replaced `RUFF_LINE_LENGTH_LIMIT` with `LONG_STRING_SPLIT_THRESHOLD` to eliminate redundant constants - **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and added better validation - **Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings explaining the purpose and behavior of each function  The tool's core functionality remains unchanged - it still generates the same type annotations, but the code is now more readable, maintainable, and follows better coding practices.  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  **⚠️ HIGH RISK - This affects a critical code generation tool used throughout the project**  - [ ] **Run the tool manually**: Execute `uv run tools/property_typing.py` to verify it still works correctly without errors - [ ] **Verify generated output**: Check that the tool generates correct type annotations by examining a few generated files in `src/io_scene_vrm/common/ops/` - [ ] **Test property handling**: Verify that all property types (StringProperty, FloatProperty, etc.) are still handled correctly by the refactored functions - [ ] **Check constant usage**: Confirm that `LONG_STRING_SPLIT_THRESHOLD` is used correctly throughout the file and string formatting works as expected - [ ] **Validate function renames**: Ensure all `_handle_*` → `handle_*` function renames were properly updated in all references  **Recommended Test Plan:** 1. Run `./tools/format.sh && ./tools/lint.sh && ./tools/test.sh` to ensure all checks pass 2. Execute `uv run tools/property_typing.py` to regenerate type annotations 3. Check `git diff` to see if any type annotation files changed unexpectedly 4.

The current implementation had unclear responsibility separation between `analyzeRequirementsNode` and `designSchemaNode`, causing message duplication and violating single responsibility principle. The `designSchemaNode` was inappropriately processing `analyzedRequirements` that should be handled entirely within `analyzeRequirementsNode`.  **Key problems addressed**: - `analyzeRequirementsNode` created only partial messages (businessRequirement only) - `designSchemaNode` re-processed `analyzedRequirements` to create user messages - This caused the same requirements data to be formatted and added to messages twice in different formats - Unclear node responsibilities made the code harder to maintain  **Solution**: Move all requirements message formatting to `analyzeRequirementsNode` where it belongs, and have `designSchemaNode` use existing messages without creating new user messages (except for DDL retry scenarios).",title provides conventional commit label,Structural / Architectural Refactoring,Devin,internal quality attribute

3246762112,"Remove optimistic actions from mail client, execute operations immediately against ZeroDriver","# Remove optimistic actions from mail client, execute operations immediately against ZeroDriver  ## Summary  This PR removes the optimistic actions system from the mail client and replaces it with immediate execution of operations against ZeroDriver's database. Previously, the mail client used optimistic updates (show changes immediately in UI, then sync to server) with undo functionality. Now, actions are executed directly against the database first, then the UI is updated based on the server response.  **Key Changes:** - **Removed optimistic state management**: Deleted `use-optimistic-actions.ts`, `optimistic-updates.ts`, `optimistic-actions-manager.ts`, and related files - **Created direct actions hook**: New `use-direct-actions.ts` that calls tRPC mutations directly - **Updated all action handlers**: Thread context menu, keyboard shortcuts, mail list actions, and bulk operations now use direct database calls - **Simplified error handling**: Replaced undo toasts with simple success/error feedback - **Removed paraglide dependencies**: Replaced localized message calls with hardcoded strings to fix compilation errors  The mail client now treats ZeroDriver as the single source of truth, as requested.  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human  - [ ] **Test core mail actions**: Mark emails as read/unread, star/unstar, archive, delete - verify they work and UI updates correctly - [ ] **Test keyboard shortcuts**: Verify hotkeys (r, a, f, e, i, #, etc.) still function for mail actions   - [ ] **Test bulk operations**: Select multiple emails and perform bulk actions (archive, delete, mark read, etc.) - [ ] **Test error scenarios**: Try actions with network issues or when server returns errors - verify error messages appear - [ ] **Check for broken references**: Search codebase for any remaining `optimistic` references that might cause runtime errors  **Recommended Test Plan**: Go through normal email workflows - reading, archiving, starring, using keyboard shortcuts, bulk selecting and acting on multiple emails. Pay special attention to whether actions feel responsive and error states are handled gracefully.  ---  ### Diagram  ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TD     %% New direct actions system     DirectActions[""apps/mail/hooks/use-direct-actions.ts""]:::major-edit          %% Components that were updated     ThreadContext[""apps/mail/components/context/thread-context.tsx""]:::major-edit     MailList[""apps/mail/components/mail/mail-list.tsx""]:::major-edit     Hotkeys[""apps/mail/lib/hotkeys/mail-list-hotkeys.tsx""]:::major-edit     GlobalHotkeys[""apps/mail/lib/hotkeys/global-hotkeys.tsx""]:::minor-edit     MailNav[""apps/mail/hooks/use-mail-navigation.ts""]:::minor-edit     MoveTo[""apps/mail/hooks/driver/use-move-to.ts""]:::minor-edit          %% Deleted files (shown for context)     OptimisticActions[""apps/mail/hooks/use-optimistic-actions.ts(DELETED)""]:::deleted     OptimisticStore[""apps/mail/store/optimistic-updates.ts(DELETED)""]:::deleted          %% tRPC backend (context)     TRPCMail[""apps/server/src/trpc/routes/mail.ts""]:::context     ZeroDriver[""apps/server/src/routes/agent/index.ts (ZeroDriver)""]:::context          %% Connections     DirectActions --> TRPCMail     TRPCMail --> ZeroDriver          ThreadContext --> DirectActions     MailList --> DirectActions       Hotkeys --> DirectActions     GlobalHotkeys --> DirectActions     MailNav --> DirectActions     MoveTo --> DirectActions          %% Show what was replaced     OptimisticActions -.-> DirectActions     OptimisticStore -.-> DirectActions          subgraph Legend         L1[Major Edit]:::major-edit         L2[Minor Edit]:::minor-edit           L3[Context/No Edit]:::context         L4[Deleted]:::deleted     end          classDef major-edit fill:#90EE90     classDef minor-edit fill:#87CEEB     classDef context fill:#FFFFFF     classDef deleted fill:#FFB6C1 ```  ### Notes  - **Base branch**: This PR is rebased onto `devin/1753044234-sync-engine-phase1` as requested - **Testing limitation**: Unable to test locally due to vite-plugin-oxlint configuration issues, so functional testing is critical - **User experience change**: Actions may feel slightly slower since they now wait for server response before showing completion - **Internationalization impact**: Paraglide message calls were replaced with hardcoded English strings  **Session details**:  - Requested by: Adam (@MrgSub) - Devin session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/43c9b3b0d6ac4c339b9ee8ccedb5b452       ---  ## Summary by cubic Removed optimistic actions from the mail client.

3260345989,Match dividend check pattern to invoice requirements,"# Match dividend check pattern to invoice requirements  ## Summary Updated the dividend signing eligibility check in the equity dividends page to match the pattern used in the invoices system. Changed the condition from checking `user.hasPayoutMethodForDividends && user.legalName` to `user.address.street_address && !!user.taxInformationConfirmedAt`, aligning with the requirement validation used in `frontend/app/(dashboard)/invoices/index.tsx:34`.  This change standardizes the eligibility criteria across the platform, ensuring consistent requirements for users to interact with financial features.  ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human - [ ] **Test dividend signing functionality** - Verify that users who should be able to sign dividend releases can still do so after this change - [ ] **Check alert message consistency** - The alert messages on lines 145-167 still reference the old conditions (`user.legalName` and `user.hasPayoutMethodForDividends`) and may need updating to match the new logic - [ ] **Verify data field availability** - Confirm that `user.address.street_address` and `user.taxInformationConfirmedAt` are properly available in the user context for this page - [ ] **Test edge cases** - Ensure users who don't meet the new criteria are properly blocked from signing, and that the UI behaves correctly in these scenarios  ---  ### Diagram ```mermaid %%{ init : { ""theme"" : ""default"" }}%% graph TD     subgraph ""Frontend Components""         A[""dividends/page.tsx(EDITED)""]:::major-edit         B[""invoices/index.tsx(Reference Pattern)""]:::context     end          subgraph ""User Object Properties""         C[""user.address.street_address""]:::context         D[""user.taxInformationConfirmedAt""]:::context         E[""user.hasPayoutMethodForDividends(REMOVED)""]:::context         F[""user.legalName(REMOVED)""]:::context     end          A -->|""Now checks""| C     A -->|""Now checks""| D     A -.->|""Previously checked""| E     A -.->|""Previously checked""| F     B -->|""Pattern source""| C     B -->|""Pattern source""| D          subgraph Legend         L1[Major Edit]:::major-edit         L2[Minor Edit]:::minor-edit           L3[Context/No Edit]:::context     end  classDef major-edit fill:#90EE90 classDef minor-edit fill:#87CEEB classDef context fill:#F5F5F5 ```  ### Notes - This change was requested via Slack channel #flexile by maya@elf.dev - The change aligns dividend signing requirements with invoice submission requirements - Local testing was not possible due to Redis connection issues in the development environment - **Important**: The alert messages below the dividend table may need updating to reflect the new eligibility criteria - Link to Devin session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/c3dfe07c101144568f4ddedb280e9690","The change updates the eligibility check logic for dividend signing to align with invoice requirements, which is a modification of existing functionality rather than a bug fix or new feature.
